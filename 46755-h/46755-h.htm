  <h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Lieutenant Bilse</span>, Beyerlein, and Baron von
Schlicht,<a id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> the author of the present work, with
their many less-known followers, have managed
among them to create what may be regarded
as a novel of a new species&mdash;the "critical"
military novel. What is commonly called the
"military novel," has, of course, long been
known in Germany, but it differed considerably
from the new species. The older military novel
gave more or less lively pictures of camp, garrison
and casino life, and the gay young lieutenant
who generally figured as hero was much adored
by ladies (as indeed he still is). But between
the lieutenant of romance and the lieutenant of
stern reality there is a gulf. Readers have now
before them the lieutenant of reality, and the
uplifting of the veil on his interesting, if not very
edifying, personality and doings, has aroused
in Germany a curious storm of indignation,
especially in army and official circles. Indeed,
as may be remembered, Baron von Schlicht<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
was "insulted" over the present work in the
Reichstag itself, and the affair went so far that
a duel nearly followed. The widespread interest
taken in these revelations of military life is
testified by the number of copies of the present
work (40,000) which have been sold in Germany,
though its circulation is now forbidden there;
while for his outspokenness in this novel it is
rumoured that Baron von Schlicht has to meet
his trial in Berlin very shortly.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_A_1"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_A_1">[A]</a></span> This is a pen-name. The author's actual name is Count
von Baudissin.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Though widely known as the author of various
military sketches and stories of a more or less
light and humorous turn, in the present case
Baron von Schlicht shows little trace of his
characteristic vein. Here, rather, he devotes
himself seriously to making what is in effect a
detailed and apparently dispassionate <i>expos√©</i>
in regard to the manners and morals of officers
of the old nobility in the German army. The
indignation aroused against him is all the greater
as he himself belongs to the old nobility which
he so freely criticises, and he has the further
advantage of speaking from inside knowledge
of the officers' caste (Offiziers-Kaste) to which
he himself belonged during his military career.
Lieutenant Bilse wrote from outside this circle
of the old nobility; thus Baron von Schlicht's
work fills a gap which Lieutenant Bilse's book
still left open.</p>

  CRACK REGIMENT</div>

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />
  <span class="smcap">By Command of the Emperor</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> "Yellow Butterflies," as Franz Ferdinand
Leopold's infantry regiment was called on account
of its yellow epaulettes, was celebrating
its anniversary; the day when, more than forty
years ago, it lost in a famous battle a third of
its rank and file and more than half of its officers.
The memory of the heroic deeds of the regiment
could not be allowed to perish; the younger
generation were continually reminded of them,
and thus the celebration of the anniversary of
the famous battle was accompanied by the
toast: "In remembrance of the fallen; for the
encouragement of the living." The fallen, for
what they had done, were given every year a
magnificent wreath tied with a gigantic ribbon
of the regimental colours; the living, who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
as yet done nothing, were given a splendid dinner
with equally splendid wine: and when the
enthusiasm aroused by the official speech of the
colonel, under the influence of the champagne,
had done its work, the officers all declared again
and again that when the regiment went into
battle they would know how to die as bravely
as their comrades&mdash;and they really meant what
they swore.</p>

<p>To-day the anniversary was being celebrated
with especial magnificence, for new officers'
quarters were to be opened, which were to be
used exclusively as a mess-room. Only at mid-day,
as he was preparing his oration, did it occur
to the colonel that the dedication of this building,
which was intended for purely pleasurable
purposes, was not altogether in harmony with
the solemn anniversary of the dead. He could
not very well say, "In order to honour the noble
dead we open to-day our new mess-room, which,
I hope, will be a financial success." Certainly
that would not do. Then a way out of the
difficulty occurred to the colonel; he would
simply say, "And we vow to the fallen heroes,
that within these walls we will above all practise
the spirit of comradeship, and the soldierly
virtues, which animated them and fitted them
to perform their heroic deeds." That would
make a suitable impression; and so in a pleasant
frame of mind he betook himself to the mess-room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
where there was much excitement and
bustle. In the morning the usual formalities
had been followed; almost all the former officers
of the regiment had appeared, the closely allied
regiments had sent deputations, and nobody
had come with empty hands. A veritable shower
of silver ornaments had been poured upon the
"Golden Butterflies," and now all were thronging
into the reception-rooms, greeting mutual
friends, admiring the presents, and awaiting
the arrival of the important officials.</p>

<p>Dinner was to take place at seven o'clock,
and on the stroke of the hour the representative
of His Majesty appeared. Originally the Emperor
had promised the regiment the honour of
his presence, but at the last moment he had
been prevented from attending.</p>

<p>The music began, and in a long procession
the company went into the dining hall. A cry
of admiration broke from the lips of everyone
at the sight of the magnificent apartment with
its gorgeous decorations and beautifully laid
table.</p>

<p>The officers of the "Golden Butterflies"
who led in the guests swaggered a bit, and drew
themselves up as much as to say, "Yes, this is
what we're like, that's how we do things. We
have been quite long enough housed in a fashion
unbecoming to our rank. But now, where is
the regiment that can boast of such apartments?"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
They knew that on account of their old mess-room,
in which, according to the declaration of
a cavalry officer of the Guards, no self-respecting
man could feel really happy, they had often
been slighted. Formerly they had been the
worst off in this respect; now they were the
best. The "Golden Butterflies" beamed; each
word of compliment and admiration which the
guests expressed sounded like heavenly music
in the ears of the officers, and each seemed as
proud as if it were due to him that at last they
had a new mess-room. And in truth, each had
done his share, for if all of them did not appreciate
so highly the calling and honour of an
officer as in bygone days, yet the officers and
friends of the regiment in earlier times could never
had raised such a large sum as was required
for the erection and furnishing of this building.
As the bearers of old and honoured names, each
of the officers was conscious of his position and
his duty, for the "Golden Butterflies" were
proud to be considered one of the haughtiest
and most exclusive of regiments in the whole
army.</p>

<p>With pride they regarded their guests, all of
whom bore important names. A lieutenant of
the Uhlans, Baron Gersbach, whom all knew
as a great gambler, stuck his eyeglass in his eye,
examined the persons at the table, and then
turned to his neighbour; "Really a highly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
select company; not a single man belonging
to the middle class is present."</p>

<p>"Yes, but there is&mdash;one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Uhlan stuck his eyeglass more firmly
in to his eye to discover which it was.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"The architect who built the place."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, he hardly counts. But why did
you invite him to dinner?"</p>

<p>"We thought about the matter for a very
long time, but we came to the conclusion we
could not do otherwise. The fellow formerly
served in this regiment for a year, and out of
attachment and love for the regiment he drew
up the plans free of cost, and he has also charged
nothing for all the trouble he has taken. Well,
we had to show ourselves equally obliging."</p>

<p>The Uhlan nodded approvingly. "Yes, I
quite understand, and such an invitation is not
only the easiest, but the most magnificent form
of thanks. To the end of his days the fellow
will live on the remembrance of this evening,
and besides that it is a splendid recommendation
for him to have dined with us. I must say,
considering his class, he seems a very decent
sort of fellow; fancy, his hands are manicured!
What's his name?"</p>

<p>"I think it's Klipper, Lipper, Wipper, or
something of that sort."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it doesn't matter. By the way,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
have you heard," went on the Uhlan, "what is
said to have happened in a line regiment at a
festival dinner? A fellow&mdash;I don't like to use
the word comrade in such a connection&mdash;well,
as I was saying, a fellow made a fool of himself,
and in his drunkenness&mdash;for I must call his
condition by that name&mdash;he gave an ensign a
sounding box on the ears at the dinner-table
because the latter, in his opinion, did not jump
up quickly enough when the besotted beast
pledged his health."</p>

<p>"It's incredible!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless it is true."</p>

<p>"Do you know what will happen next?"</p>

<p>Baron Gersbach shrugged his shoulders.
"What can happen? They cannot fight a
duel, for it is impossible for an ensign to challenge
his superior."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is so," agreed the other.</p>

<p>"There are only two possible ways of settling
the thing: either the lieutenant, if he should
ever become sober again, must beg the ensign's
pardon in the presence of the officers and all
those who witnessed the affair, or the lieutenant
must flee, and then the ensign must settle with
himself whether he will go on living with the
blow on his cheek unavenged. But in any case
his career is all over&mdash;at any rate in our regiment.
An ensign who had suffered such a box
on the ears would not be made an officer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Both were silent for a moment, then the signal
was given to fill the glasses. The two officers
drank each other's health, and the Uhlan continued:
"One can't help feeling very sorry
for the unfortunate ensign; he is said to have
been entirely blameless in the whole affair, and
to attack an ensign is really far worse than
to insult one's equal. But these things happen
to-day because they are not more careful in the
choice of men who are going to be officers. To-day,
anybody who has the necessary cash, and belongs
to a family that has not come into conflict with
the police, can become a lieutenant."</p>

<p>The other acquiesced. "Alas, it is such a
pity that the necessity of increasing our army
forces us to choose officers from the middle
class."</p>

<p>The Uhlan emptied his glass again, and then
said: "You are quite right, although it cannot
be denied that some of the middle class are very
decent. I must own that I became acquainted
with a couple of fellows&mdash;in our regiment of
course they would have been quite impossible&mdash;but
I met them several times in the
train&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The officer of the "Golden Butterflies" looked
up with astonishment. "Do you mean to say
that you travel second class?"</p>

<p>"Who, I?" At first the Uhlan was quite
disconcerted, then he laughed loud and long:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
"What a joke! Do you suppose I travel second
class? Perhaps you'll give me a free pass?
Or do you think I act as an agent, perhaps?
If I were to write this to my dear papa he would
be highly amused."</p>

<p>It was long before the Uhlan had recovered
his composure, then he said: "When I said just
now I had got to know these fellows in the train,
I was speaking figuratively. I meant a mere
passing acquaintanceship, and as I told you
these people were really quite nice, it was very
amusing to me to talk with a fellow from the
provinces who lives in such different circumstances.
I was highly amused when they told
me how they spent their month's salary of fifty
or sixty marks. Just think, why, my hairdresser
gets that!" Then quite suddenly he
broke off and said: "By the way, we were
disputing yesterday at mess as to how long it
really was since the last officer belonging to
the middle class had his discharge from your
regiment."</p>

<p>"On 15th May it will be four years."</p>

<p>The Uhlan looked up astonished. "Just fancy,
you remember the exact date!"</p>

<p>"Well, one does not easily forget such a
joyful date."</p>

<p>"You are quite right, but haven't you got a
<i>bourgeois</i> fellow among the ensigns?"</p>

<p>"Not a single one. The colonel has laid it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
down that under no circumstances whatever will
he receive such a man."</p>

<p>"Very sensible of him. First of all, such a
fellow would not suit here at all; secondly,
he would be a great source of annoyance to
you; thirdly, he himself would feel highly uncomfortable.
The proper thing is for people
to remain in their own class. And the common
people who will not understand that talk about
'Caste' feeling and the 'Aristocratic Spirit'!&mdash;well,
let them talk, what does it matter to
us?"</p>

<p>After a slight pause the officer of the "Golden
Butterflies" said: "Do you know I have been
thinking a good deal lately about that 'Caste'
feeling and aristocratic prejudice. Whenever the
Guards give a dinner the glasses are raised to
symbolise that the spirit which inspires the
officers must remain ever the same. Now I
think this means that not only must we ever
cherish love and fidelity for the ruling house,
but also that we must ever remain 'first-class
men,' with the same ideas as we hold now. As
bearers of noble names, and belonging to the
most important regiment, we must ever be
conscious of our exclusive position, and so stand
firmly together, and we must maintain strictly
the barrier that divides us from the middle
class. Let us drink once more to this hope; that
the Guards may ever remain what we now are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>&mdash;bearers
of the oldest names, 'first-class'
men!"</p>

<p>The conversation of his neighbour had been
far too long for the Uhlan, who had scarcely
listened to what he was saying; nevertheless
he re-echoed his words, "Let us drink." But
just as he was about to raise his glass a universal
shout arose; the colonel had risen and given
the first cheer for the head of the army, and the
second to the representative of His Majesty,
who was there present.</p>

<p>After a short pause the latter rose to thank
them for the honour they had done him, then
he continued: "His Majesty has commanded
me to express his extreme regret that he cannot
be present to-day at the anniversary festival
of the regiment; His Majesty has been pleased
to command me to offer to the regiment that has
always distinguished itself in war and peace his
royal greeting, and to assure the regiment of
his imperial favour and his imperial good wishes.
His Majesty is quite sure that in the future,
as in the past, he may always depend upon the
regiment, and he knows that each of you is ready
now as ever to sacrifice his life for his country
and his king, therefore His Majesty trusts that
the spirit that has always distinguished this
regiment&mdash;the spirit of good fellowship&mdash;shall
be always fostered, and especially, here in these
rooms."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>The exalted personage paused, and a murmur
of approval ran through the assembled officers
and guests who were standing up to listen to
the speech.</p>

<p>"Now the health of the regiment is going to
be drunk," they all said, and they looked to see
whether their glasses were full, for it was due to
each man that in his own regiment his glass should
be full.</p>

<p>But the expected conclusion of the speech
was not immediately forthcoming; the exalted
personage was visibly embarrassed, and it was
apparent to everyone that he had still something
to say, but could not for the moment find the
right words. At last he regained his composure,
and said: "Gentlemen, finally, His Majesty has
commanded me to inform you that to-day he
has transferred to your regiment Lieutenant
Winkler, the son of His Majesty's commercial
adviser, who was formerly in the 25th Infantry
Regiment. And now, gentlemen," continued
the Prince, in a louder tone, and visibly relieved,
"lift your glasses to the prosperity of this magnificent
regiment, whose officers unite in themselves
the best names in the land, and whose subalterns
and rank and file present a shining example of the
most faithful fulfilment of duty&mdash;here's to the
regiment. Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!"</p>

<p>They felt as if they had been throttled; such
a sorrowful "hurrah" had never before been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
heard, and it was a fortunate thing that the
loud-sounding fanfare echoed through the hall.</p>

<p>The "hurrahs" were over, His Highness had
taken his seat again, but the rest remained standing,
staring at each other as if they could not
have heard aright, as if each wanted to learn
from his neighbour's face whether what he had
just heard could really be the fact.</p>

<p>"We have become a plebeian regiment."</p>

<p>Nobody knew who pronounced the word first,
but at once the phrase passed from lip to lip&mdash;"We
have become plebeian."</p>

<p>It was just as if a jug of cold water had been
thrown into their faces, and indeed when at
last they sat down to the table again and the
music struck up a merry <i>potpourri</i>, they could
not grasp, they could not take it in, this inevitable
thing&mdash;that once more a "commoner"
was in the regiment.</p>

<p>All their gay spirits had fled; indeed it appeared
to the officers of the "Golden Butterflies"
as if a quite new spirit had taken possession of
the building. The festival had lost its splendour;
it seemed as if the silver itself suddenly shone
less brilliantly, as if the glass were less finely
cut, and as if the hall no longer possessed the
unique elegance that had hitherto distinguished it.</p>

<p>A painful silence reigned at the table, the
"Golden Butterflies" did not venture to talk
to their guests, for they knew they would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
besieged by questions as to who and what this
Winkler really was, where he came from, whatever
could have caused His Majesty to transfer
him from his frontier garrison town to this proud
and distinguished regiment. It must have some
signification. They did not venture even to look
at their guests, for they knew that in the faces of
the latter would stand clearly written: "You
are no longer what you were; you cannot indeed
help it that you have become plebeian, but the
fact remains, and your position will be affected
by this in the future."</p>

<p>If only the news that they were to receive a
plebeian lieutenant had been communicated to
them privately&mdash;but no, it had been announced
publicly, in the presence of all the assembled
guests, so that there was no possibility of denial
or subterfuge. It was a direct slap in the face
for them, and for the former officers, some of
whom had come from a distance to be present
at the dedication of the new buildings. And
now into that new house a new element had
been introduced. A commoner! Why had the
regiment deserved it that the glory that had
hitherto distinguished it should be removed?
On the former occasion when a plebeian lieutenant
had dwelt among them for a short time they had
all suffered, and it was esteemed a special mark
of the Emperor's favour that on the personally
expressed wish of the officers he had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
transferred to a line regiment. When they were
again relieved of the stigma, each had sworn
to live more zealously for the honour of the
regiment so that a plebeian should not for a
second time be received in their midst. Now
this very thing had happened.</p>

<p>The Uhlan had regarded for a long time his
neighbour who was looking gloomily in front
of him; now he felt impelled to utter a sympathetic
word, and everything that he felt in the
depth of his heart he put into the remark, "What
a pity! you were all so jolly in your regiment."</p>

<p>The officer of the "Golden Butterflies" shrugged
his shoulders. What did these words mean
but this: "The beginning has been made,
other commoners will follow this one, and even
if he does remain the only one, you will never
be again what you once were."</p>

<p>The Uhlans were considered a frightfully
exclusive regiment, and the "Golden Butterflies"
had made the greatest efforts to maintain
friendly and cordial relations with them. At
last they had succeeded, and to-day the Uhlans
almost to a man had appeared; the most aristocratic
of regiments had been <i>f√™ted</i> with a costly
dinner; and now, scarcely had the friendship
been sealed when it was immediately threatened.</p>

<p>All breathed more freely when at last they
rose from the table; the "Golden Butterflies"
were most anxious to talk to each other, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
learn something more of their new comrade.
Somebody or other must know something about
him; the fellow must have some sort of reputation&mdash;as
much as was possible for a commoner,
of course&mdash;otherwise His Majesty would not
have interested himself on his behalf.</p>

<p>It was in this way that the men who had
fallen into two groups&mdash;the guests, and the
present and former officers&mdash;expressed their
opinions; each had something to say as to his
idea concerning the event.</p>

<p>The "Golden Butterflies" surrounded the
adjutant of the regiment, Count Wettborn;
he had become quite white, and was nervously
fidgeting with the laces of his faultless patent-leather
boots. After the colonel the matter concerned
him most closely of all; he was often
the representative and delegate of the officers,
and now, was he to become a representative of
a Winkler, he, a count? He was tall, of proud,
imposing appearance; on his breast glittered
as his latest decoration an order of the Fourth
Class, which he had won as leader of the ball at
court. For two years he had occupied this
proud position; it was not only a great honour
for him, but also for the whole regiment, and
when he had stepped back into the rank he had
been named adjutant, and all had heartily concurred
in this promotion, deeming him the
most worthy among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, count, do tell us, you must know something,
who is this Winkler, then?"</p>

<p>Anxiously they all looked at the count; dead
silence reigned, they scarcely dared to breathe.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," at last said the adjutant,
"whatever the colonel and I know we have
just learnt from His Serene Highness. Old
Winkler is a manufacturer."</p>

<p>They felt as if a stone had been rolled from
their hearts. A manufacturer! It was not
up to much, certainly, and not to be compared,
of course, with the social position of a country
gentleman or a chamberlain; but still, Krupp
had been nothing more nor less than a manufacturer,
and the German Emperor had called
him his friend before the whole world. A load
was taken from their hearts; but immediately
they all saw that the count had still something
on his mind, and that the question of being a
manufacturer had some connection with it.</p>

<p>"And what does the fellow manufacture?
Cannon or machines?"</p>

<p>"Neither&mdash;trouser buttons." If a flash of
lightning had suddenly struck the officers they
could not have started more quickly and with
greater horror.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" They looked around to
see if any of the guests or the orderlies were
close by, and then they crowded round the
adjutant again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Belitz, a very tall officer, was the first to
recover himself; he was on very good terms with
the adjutant, almost his friend indeed, and so
he ventured to say, "Don't play any stupid
jokes upon us, we are not in the mood for them,
and such things should not be said in jest. Now
do really tell us what the old fellow manufactures."</p>

<p>The count looked at the speaker calmly. "My
dear fellow, I am not in the least in the mood for
a joke, but I told you the fact. Old Winkler
manufactures buttons, of course, wholesale. He
has three large factories, and employs thousands
of workmen, who are said to be splendidly looked
after. For several years he has been on the
Town Council, and for three he has been commercial
adviser to the Emperor; quite lately
he contributed a hundred thousand marks to
a charitable institution which is under the special
patronage of His Majesty, and he has also promised
a contribution of twenty thousand marks
for the next five years. He refused an important
order that was offered him, and when he was
asked in what way he could be thanked, he
answered that it would be an intense pleasure
to him if his only son might be transferred from
a frontier garrison town to Berlin, so that he
could see him more frequently. His wish could
not be refused, and so his son has come to us."</p>

<p>After a slight pause, during which the deepest
stillness reigned, the adjutant continued: "The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
transference of Lieutenant Winkler to our regiment
is at the personal request of His Majesty.
It behoves us, therefore, not to criticise His
Majesty's commands. I beg you to remember
this, and to restrain any expressions of
opinion."</p>

<p>It was perfectly clear and unmistakable that
the adjutant spoke in the name, and at the
request of the colonel, and silently one after
another retired.</p>

<p>But the silence was far more expressive than
words. Dejectedly the "Golden Butterflies"
walked about; they had not the spirit to ask
their guests to remain when, much earlier than
usual, the latter prepared to depart. It was a
matter of complete indifference whether they
stayed an hour longer or not; the spirit of the
thing had vanished; the festivity was ruined.
The rooms were soon empty, one after another
departed, only the "Golden Butterflies" remained.
And they, when at last they were quite
alone, asked themselves again, "Why have we
deserved this?"</p>

<p>In one corner of the room, all huddled up on
a sofa, sat young Willberg, the darling and
favourite of all, a young lieutenant of six-and-twenty,
whose father had been in the regiment
and had won the Iron Cross of the First Class
on that memorable day. Young Willberg had
evidently indulged somewhat freely in wine;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
he was in a state of abject misery, and wept and
sobbed like a child.</p>

<p>"Willberg, whatever is the matter?" his
comrades asked him sympathetically, as they
came nearer him.</p>

<p>He raised his face which was usually fresh
and youthful-looking, but now the glittering
tears ran down his cheeks, and in a heart-breaking
tone of voice he sobbed out: "My regiment, my
beloved regiment."</p>

<p>Not a single one of those who stood around
him could offer him a word of consolation&mdash;they
were all as mournful as death.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

  <h2>CHAPTER II<br />
  <span class="smcap">Introduced to the Regiment</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">"<span class="smcap">To-day</span> at twelve o'clock I desire to speak
with the officers in undress uniform."</p>

<p>The colonel's command was communicated to
all the officers, and now, full of expectation,
they were standing outside the mess-room. To
the questions: "What's the matter with the
old fellow now? Has anyone got cleaned out?"
the answer was immediately given: "Winkler
came to-day and is to be introduced to us all."</p>

<p>And this universal answer was followed on
each occasion by a universal "Ah"&mdash;an expression
of the deepest commiseration and the
greatest disappointment. Winkler had really
come? How many ardent prayers had not
been raised to heaven that he would <i>not</i> come!
And in his innermost heart each man had still
hoped that the order of exchange would be
recalled. His Majesty had heard privately,
through inquiries of an adjutant, what they
thought about this new comrade; they had
not concealed their views, but instead of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
hoped-for order of recall, the adjutant had one
day reappeared, and had quite casually, and
in the way of conversation, yet in spite of that,
with an official air, given them to understand
that His Majesty was very vexed at what he
had heard of the officers' views concerning
Lieutenant Winkler. His Majesty had expressed
his sincerest hope that the regiment would
receive their new member with open arms.
The adjutant's words had not failed to have
effect; not that the officers suddenly changed
their views, but they took care not to say what
they thought in his presence any more.</p>

<p>Now Winkler had really come. "What does
he look like?" "What sort of an impression
does he make?" "Has anyone spoken to
him?"</p>

<p>There was a torrent of questions. Suddenly
it struck twelve, and to the minute the colonel
appeared with his adjutant and Lieutenant
Winkler.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant motioned the officers to
their places, and the colonel immediately began:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I have requested you to meet
me in order to introduce to you our new comrade,
Lieutenant Winkler. Allow me to introduce
you, Lieutenant Winkler."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Winkler stepped forward and
saluted in a friendly way; he stood there erect
and courteous, a man of medium size, slim,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
yet strong. He was a very well developed
man, and the becoming uniform of the "Golden
Butterflies," with its rich gold embroidery,
suited him excellently; on his young and fresh-looking
countenance&mdash;he was twenty-seven years
of age&mdash;with its thick, light moustache, and in
his clear, blue eyes, was written energy and
independence. Many of the officers there present
could scarcely conceal a certain unrest and
embarrassment. Winkler's face alone remained
absolutely cool.</p>

<p>The "Golden Butterflies" examined their
new comrade with searching eyes, just as if
they were examining a horse that had been led
before them. They cast a glance at his figure,
at his legs, looked him over to see if he would
do well at a parade march, and whether his
outward appearance was equal to the demands
which were made on a member of so important
a regiment. According as they were satisfied
with their examination, they put their hands
more or less cordially, or in some cases only a
finger, to their caps.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Winkler," continued the colonel,
"a very great honour has been paid you; at
the direct request of His Majesty you have been
made a member of a regiment which can look
back on a glorious past, and whose officers have
always been distinguished for the purity of
their character, the gallantry of their spirit and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
their honourable lives, both as soldiers and
gentlemen. You come among us from a different
garrison, from totally different surroundings.
You have been bred and reared in circumstances
where people do not hold the same views as we
do. It must be your first endeavour to become,
in the truest sense of the word, one of us, for
the uniform does not make the man, it is the
spirit which puts the seal on him. And the
financial material circumstances of a man are
not without their influence on the <i>esprit de
corps</i> of a regiment. You, Lieutenant Winkler,
probably have the disposal of an allowance
which is so large that it bears no relation to
the small amounts which most of my officers
have to do with. You, sir, have grown up in
a circle where money plays the most important
part, where, to a certain extent, the honour
in which a man is held depends upon the size
of his banking account. But our great pride is
that, with our small means, or rather I should
say, in spite of our small means, we remain
what we are. In course of time you will see
for yourself how many of your comrades are
obliged to stint themselves merely to make
both ends meet, and how they are obliged to
deprive themselves of all kinds of things in
order to maintain a dignified appearance. Although
I am delighted to hear that, while you
were living in a small garrison town, you were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
economical and eschewed all luxuries, now that
you are transferred to Berlin I must beg you
most earnestly, and warn you most emphatically,
to resist the various temptations that will assail
you here. Keep to the modest mode of life,
and do not fall into the fault, so easy to youth,
of boasting of your riches and wealth, and of
playing for large stakes with your comrades.
If you attend to my admonition, then a friendly
and cordial relationship will grow up between
you and these gentlemen, to whom you are now
a stranger." And, turning to the adjutant, he
continued: "Count, I beg you to introduce
Lieutenant Winkler now to the individual
officers."</p>

<p>The introductions were made strictly according
to etiquette, beginning with the lieutenant-colonel
and ending with the youngest lieutenant.</p>

<p>It was only when the names of the lieutenants
were read out that there was any sign of life
in Winkler's bearing. During the colonel's long
speech, and while the names of his superior
officers were being read, he stood immovable,
his hand in the attitude of salute&mdash;and everyone
had to admit that he stood well&mdash;without moving
or swerving. His face was so well under control
that not a muscle moved, and not a line
on his countenance betrayed what he felt at
the colonel's remarks. When the names of
the lieutenants were given&mdash;he saluted the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
lieutenants as his superiors&mdash;his bearing relaxed
somewhat, and he returned the salutes of his
comrades cordially. And he saluted well&mdash;everybody
had to admit that likewise.</p>

<p>At last he was able to release his hand, and
stand at ease once more; his arm was almost
numb and the muscles of his legs trembled and
smarted, but by no sign did he betray this.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Winkler is placed in the second
battalion, fifth company."</p>

<p>All glances were directed towards the captain
of the fifth company, Baron von Warnow; he
was considered the most important officer in
the regiment; he was of very ancient descent,
which he could trace back to the Emperor Barbarossa,
in whose campaigns a Warnow had
distinguished himself. He was married to a
Countess M√§ilny, had a very large fortune, and
his house was considered the most aristocratic
in Berlin. Whenever it was a question of representing
the regiment, or of sending a deputation
anywhere, it was Baron von Warnow who was
always nominated. On account of his birth and
his connection with the most important families
in the country he was pre-eminently fitted for
such appointments. And he was just as distinguished
in his military career as in his private
life. He permitted no swearing or bad behaviour
among his officers. He attempted, as
his comrades laughingly said, to make a gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of every musketeer, and in his first lieutenant,
Baron von Felsen, he had an excellent assistant.
For the last fortnight he had only had one officer
attached to his company, for a short time ago
his lieutenant had been thrown while riding and
had broken his arm. It would be at least a
month before he could be on active service
again, but it had never occurred to him that
another officer would be assigned to him.</p>

<p>And now he was to have Lieutenant Winkler
in his company&mdash;he, Baron von Warnow!</p>

<p>He could scarcely conceal his annoyance;
his thick brows contracted, and he was about
to mutter something in a rage when he met
Winkler's glance. The latter, when he heard
his captain's name, looked round to see which
among the many to whom he had been introduced
was Baron von Warnow. When he saw
the latter's disappointed and almost furious
countenance, he knew at once that that was
the Baron! He fixed his eyes upon him almost
as if he was saying: "What harm have I done
you?" Perhaps his face became a shade paler,
but his voice had its quiet, steady tone when
he stepped up to his superior officer and saluted
him.</p>

<p>Baron von Warnow returned the salute by a
bare finger, then he said: "It would have been
more in order if you had, first of all, saluted
your major."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Winkler flushed red, then he repaired the
omission and stepped up to Baron von Masemann,
his superior lieutenant, in order to get
to know him a little better as they were to be
in the same company. He took his friendliness
as a matter of course, but he merely received a
curt, "I am much obliged to you."</p>

<p>The colonel conversed with the staff officers;
the other officers chattered in various groups.
Winkler stood quite alone, nobody troubled about
him, and he breathed more freely when the
colonel at last dismissed the officers.</p>

<p>As Winkler was turning to go, his captain,
who was talking to the first lieutenant, called to
him: "One moment, if you please, Lieutenant
Winkler," and after a little pause continued:
"I do not know, Lieutenant Winkler, whether
you are already aware of the fact, otherwise
I had better tell you at once, that a thoroughly
good and healthy tone is maintained
in my company; I must therefore beg you
to avoid all cursing and swearing, my men
are accustomed to be treated as decent persons.
It is a very great honour for you to
be in my company, and it is to be hoped that
you will strive to maintain it worthily." And
turning to his first lieutenant he continued:
"My dear baron, if at first Lieutenant Winkler
does not find it easy to maintain the right tone,
you will be kind enough to help him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>The first lieutenant acquiesced with a salute,
then the captain turned again to Winkler:
"We shall see each other again to-morrow on
duty; kindly give the sergeant-major your
address, so that we may know where to send
the orders."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>"Then there is nothing more for me to say.
I am obliged to you for coming, gentlemen."</p>

<p>The two lieutenants turned to go, and silently
they walked together over the great courtyard.
It was not till they had passed the door of the
mess-room that the baron said: "We do not
dine till six o'clock; will you join us in the
mess-room for lunch?"</p>

<p>But Winkler declined. "I must go and
report myself to the superior authorities, and,
besides, I have still a good deal to do."</p>

<p>The other did not press him further, and so
with a few words they took leave of one another.</p>

<p>Winkler called a fly; it was nearly three
o'clock when he at last reached the hotel in
which he had taken rooms for the time being.</p>

<p>"Have any letters come for me?" he inquired.
He had had no news from home for three days;
he had telegraphed to his parents that he would
be in Berlin to-day, and he hoped to receive a
warm letter of greeting from them.</p>

<p>The porter looked through the letters.</p>

<p>"Nothing has come for you, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Winkler could scarcely conceal his disappointment.
Just to-day when he felt so terribly
solitary and alone a kindly letter from his parents
would have been so very welcome. He had
been quite prepared for not being warmly welcomed
by his new regiment, but he had not had
the faintest idea that the officers would have
received him with such coldness and such aversion.</p>

<p>"The key is in the room upstairs, sir."</p>

<p>With a troubled air he went upstairs. To
his astonishment the door of the sitting-room
was not locked, and when he opened it and
walked into the rooms he was greeted with a
loud, hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! George, my boy, here's a surprise
for you, isn't it? I told the porter I'd wring
his neck if he told you of my arrival; for two
hours I've been sitting here and waiting for
you. Now, thank heaven, you're here at last.
And how fine you look, my boy, your mother
would burst with pride if she could see you
now. Of course, the first thing you'll do is to
go and be photographed."</p>

<p>And with justifiable paternal pride and the
keenest delight the manufacturer to His Majesty
embraced his son.</p>

<p>When George had at last freed himself, he said:</p>

<p>"Father, this is indeed a surprise. However
did you get here?"</p>

<p>The old man, about sixty years of age, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
medium height and strongly built, with a broad
ruddy face, large grey eyes and thick bushy
brows, whose appearance all betokened iron
will and energy and great self-confidence, looked
at his son with a satisfied glance. "Do you
know your father so little, that you thought
he would let you be here alone to-day? I
wanted to help you to find rooms, but above
all I wanted to hear how things were going
with you, and to hear everything that people
had said to you to-day. Now begin and tell
me everything."</p>

<p>George had taken off his helmet and scarf,
and changed his military coat for a comfortable
loose jacket; then he took one of the cigars
which his father offered him, and sank down
into a chair.</p>

<p>"Now, my boy, do begin and tell me everything;
surely you can talk while you're changing
your things. I know you always say, 'One
thing at a time,' but I say one can do several
things at the same time. Do you think I
should have succeeded so well if I had done
otherwise? Why, to-day, I had my lunch
standing, with my left hand I ate, and with
my right I wrote several notes, and at the same
time I gave my clerks all kinds of orders and
commissions. So now, fire away."</p>

<p>With an expectant expression the manufacturer
looked at his son who still remained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
silent, but at last he said: "Father, it's all
happened as I told you it would when you said
you had asked for me to be exchanged. It all
happened precisely as I said it would, only it
was ever so much worse."</p>

<p>The old man got up and looked at his son
with wide-open eyes. "Do you mean to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean to say," continued his son, "that
they received me in the regiment in such a
manner as might have made me not only blush
with shame but burn with rage and anger, as
in fact I did inwardly. I was, however, able to
control the expression of my feelings, as I always
can. They treated me to a long discourse, they
exhorted me to do my duty, and they kept
on rubbing it into me that it was a tremendous
honour to belong to their regiment."</p>

<p>"It certainly is that," his father agreed.
"You should have seen how people opened
their eyes when I told all our friends and acquaintances
that I had been able to get you
transferred to the 'Golden Butterflies.' In fact
they would not believe it until they saw it in
black and white. I assure you, my boy, it's
not been an easy matter and it's an expensive
luxury. Two hundred thousand marks is not
a small sum; but I don't grudge the money."</p>

<p>"But, as far as I am concerned, I not only
believe&mdash;I am convinced&mdash;it's money badly laid
out. When you wrote to me first of all that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
you were interesting yourself about my exchange,
did I not beg you, as urgently as I could, not to
continue your efforts? You laughed at me, and
wrote, 'The "Golden Butterflies" will soon
know what sort of a man they have in the son
of the manufacturer by special appointment
to His Majesty, and if they do not know they
will soon have to learn it.'"</p>

<p>"And they will learn it, my son, I assure
you."</p>

<p>George shook his head. "They will never
do that, father, for they will never take the
trouble to get to know me. They regard me as
an interloper, a stranger. Even to-day I am
quite sure that they are only waiting for the
moment when they will be able to get rid of me
decently. They will watch me closely, they
will weigh carefully all that I say, everything
I do, until at last they can find some ground
for saying to me, 'My dear sir, you are not
the right man for such a regiment as ours.' And
one fine morning I shall find myself again in a
little garrison town."</p>

<p>The old man burst forth&mdash;"Oh, oh, we've
not got as far as that yet, and before that happens
I shall have a word to say, I can tell you. I
stand well in the Emperor's favour, and at the
appointed hour I shall know how to open my
mouth."</p>

<p>George shrugged his shoulders. "Then it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
will be too late and of no use, and, besides,
you would not like the officers to be forced to
keep me against their will. I have suffered
enough already in coming here contrary to their
wishes, or do you suppose that I should not
bitterly resent it that not one single word of
welcome was given me, not a single hand was
stretched out to me in greeting."</p>

<p>The veins stood out on the old man's forehead.
"What do these stuck-up aristocrats mean?
What do they pride themselves upon? Simply
because they were by chance cradled in an
aristocratic family. Is it any merit to them
that they have a count or a baron for a father?
I can't help laughing at them! If that is all
that they can pride themselves upon, then I
am, indeed, truly sorry for these stuck-up aristocrats.
To be born the son of a noble is surely
no merit; but to be, as I am, the son of an
inferior official who, through his own energy and
diligence, has worked his way up and reached
an important position, that, indeed, is a thing
to be proud of. And if these people do not
understand that, it must be because they will
not or cannot, because they are so pig-headed
and stupid."</p>

<p>The manufacturer had jumped up, and was
striding up and down the room in a rage. George
understood his father and knew that when
he was in that mood he must give free vent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
to his fury, and must regain his composure
before he was accessible to anybody's reasons.
So he quietly let the old man rage, until at last,
with a mighty curse, he sank into a chair again.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I am all right again now.
I can't help thinking, my boy, you look at things
in too black a light. One can't altogether
blame these fellows for regarding you to a certain
extent as an outsider, and if one takes a rational
view of things it is quite understandable, that
they did not receive you with outstretched
arms. These officers do not know you; they
know absolutely nothing about you except
that you are the son of your father, and as I
have not been born with a coronet on my
head that's not enough for them. They must,
and they will, get to know you yourself. When
I consider the matter quietly, and I am in a
sober frame of mind now, I must confess that
the reception you had is not altogether displeasing
to me. Lieutenants are not like schoolgirls
who swear eternal friendship in the first
five minutes. Why should the 'Golden Butterflies'
be beside themselves with joy at the
sight of you? Simply because you're a handsome
fellow? No, no, my boy. It rests with
you to make your own position in the regiment,
and that you will make it I am perfectly certain."</p>

<p>"At least I will try, father, and it shall
not be my fault if I do not succeed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why ever should you not succeed? Don't
begin in that spirit. Hold your head high.
Look courageously into the future. Whatever
a man bestirs himself eagerly to get can be
got&mdash;and there's no more to be said."</p>

<p>George acquiesced. "Yes, let us drop the
subject; the future alone can decide which of
us is right. But there is one thing I should
very much like to know, and you did not answer
that question in your letters&mdash;wasn't it my
mother's idea to get me transferred from a
line regiment to the Guards?"</p>

<p>The manufacturer laughed complacently.
"Well, if you really must know you're right,
my boy, in your surmise. You know your
mother&mdash;she's a treasure, but she would not
be a woman if the money, title, and position
which men sing of did not turn her head a little.
We live in good style nowadays, partly on
account of your sister Elsa. We entertain a
great deal, and sometimes it was not very pleasant
for your mother when she was asked where
you were, to have to admit that you were stationed
in some miserable little place with a
second-rate regiment. Of course, no one actually
said anything, but your mother read quite
clearly in their faces&mdash;'You see there are still
some doors that money will not open.' That
naturally vexed and annoyed your mother and
wounded her vanity; she has only one son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
you must remember, and in her opinion the best
is not good enough for him. She dinned this
so constantly in my ears that at last I did what
she wanted."</p>

<p>"That is just exactly what I thought," said
George. "I can see my mother doing this, how
she coaxed you&mdash;I know every word that she
said. Well, she certainly meant it for my benefit,
and now I do hope she is very happy."</p>

<p>The manufacturer burst out laughing.
"Happy, my boy? I tell you no words can
express the happiness she feels now. She is
always dressed nowadays in the best silk dress
which was formerly reserved for the grandest
occasions."</p>

<p>George could not help laughing, and they
went on talking about the mother and sister,
who was devotedly loved by her brother, of
the home and the factory, until the hour struck,
and George remembered that it was high time
for him to be going to dinner.</p>

<p>The manufacturer made a wry face. "Can't
we dine together? I thought that in honour
of this day we might have ordered at a first-class
restaurant a dinner which would have
aroused the envy of the immortal gods."</p>

<p>"To-day that is quite impossible, father;
on the very first day I must under no circumstances
be absent from the mess dinner; perhaps
to-morrow I may be free."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man growled with vexation. "To-morrow
is not to-day; however, it can't be
helped." And then after a short pause he
said: "Can I not dine with you in the mess-room?
I thought perhaps I ought to call
on your immediate superiors, or, at any rate,
upon your colonel."</p>

<p>George was somewhat embarrassed. He was
a good son, was proud of his father and greatly
loved him, and just because of this he wanted
to prevent people seeing anything odd in his
manners at dinner; above all he was anxious
that his companions should have no occasion
to make remarks about anything in his behaviour
that displeased them. Besides, he was afraid
that his father, whose passionate, quick temper
he was only too well aware of, might lose his
self-control and make unflattering remarks which
could only harm them both. So he said hesitatingly;
"I'm afraid that would scarcely do,
father; it is an old custom in the army that
on the first time an officer dines with his new
comrades he is invited by them as a guest, and as
such he naturally cannot bring a guest with him."</p>

<p>The old man understood this more easily
than George had dared to hope. "Very well,
then, I must drink my Rhine wine by myself;
we shall see each other again before we go to
bed, and then you must tell me everything that
happened."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>But when George returned about ten o'clock
he had nothing much to relate, at least nothing
very pleasant. The dinner had been all right;
they had, of course, drunk his health, but that
was all; the officers' quarters were splendid,
and George gave a long account of these until
his father at last said "Good-night" to him.</p>

<p>George went up to his room, but he lay awake
a long time, and thought over what he had not
related to his father. The oldest officer at
dinner had bade him welcome briefly, but the
words had sounded cold, and George said to
himself that he only spoke because he was obliged
to, and there was no heartiness in his words.
The speech was followed by a cheer, glasses were
clinked, and then the affair was over. No one
had given him an invitation.</p>

<p>"Why did I not remain where I was? What's
going to happen in the future?"</p>

<p>This question kept him awake a long time,
and when at last he fell asleep he saw his mother's
glad eyes beaming with joy at the distinction
which had been given to her son.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER III<br />
  <span class="smcap">Among the Aristocracy</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> regiment had been back from the man&oelig;uvres
for five weeks, recruits had been enlisted, and the
military and social festivities of the winter season
in Berlin had begun. No one had looked forward
to the beginning of winter more anxiously
than George. Although he had been in the
"Golden Butterflies" nearly six months he
was still as much a stranger to all his comrades
as on the first day, for all his attempts to fraternise
with them had been frustrated by their passive
resistance. Now that the winter festivities had
begun he hoped to get into more friendly relationship
with the officers.</p>

<p>To-day, Captain von Warnow, who had an
elegant house with beautifully large rooms,
was giving a dance, and had invited the whole
regiment. Everybody was delighted, for entertainments
at the Warnows were quite different
from the usual official parties.</p>

<p>The Warnow's niece, Fr√§ulein von Wiedemann,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
a tall, slender, very beautiful brunette of three-and-twenty,
was staying with them, as she did
every winter. The young baroness was an
acknowledged beauty, and although during the
last year or two she had lost some of her charms,
she was still considered a very beautiful girl.
Her whole air and bearing were distinguished,
for she was an aristocrat through and through.
The Wiedemanns belonged to a very old family,
and she had been strictly brought up in the
principles of her class. Her father had been
formerly an officer in a Guards regiment, for
whom a great military future had been prophesied,
but one day he had made a mistake during
an inspection of his battalion, and now, as during
his military career he had spent all his own
limited private means, he lived with his wife and
daughter in a small town on a pension of about
four thousand marks (¬£200) a year. His only
son was an officer in an important Artillery
regiment. Great poverty reigned in the household
of the pensioned major: the allowance
which his son required to keep up appearances
in his regiment swallowed up half his pension,
and the other half, in spite of all efforts, was not
sufficient to defray the ordinary expenses of
living. Consequently the major was up to his
ears in debt.</p>

<p>At first he had not troubled himself much
about this. Hildegarde, his beautiful daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
would one day make a great match, and would
then pay all his debts. But the years passed,
and the splendid match did not come off. Hildegarde
would never marry well as long as she
remained in a little provincial town; then
Frau von Warnow, who was connected with
the Wiedemanns, and was very fond of Hildegarde,
came forward and said she would find
a suitable <i>parti</i> for her. Five years ago Hildegarde
had gone to Berlin for her first visit; on
all sides she had aroused admiration, their
Majesties had noticed her at court festivities,
but she was not yet engaged.</p>

<p>Not that suitors were lacking; one after
another had endeavoured to win her favour,
but each in turn drew back when he heard
of her lack of dowry. None of the officers
of the Guards&mdash;and neither Frau von Warnow
nor Hildegarde would have looked at anyone
else&mdash;was rich enough to marry a girl whose
marriage portion consisted of her beauty and
a whole family plunged in debt. For it was not
only the father's debts that a son-in-law would
have to pay, but a brother's, for the latter was
known as a giddy spendthrift and gambler.
Hildegarde's father could not in the least understand
why after her first winter in Berlin she
returned home without a <i>fianc√©</i>. He had so
absolutely reckoned upon a wealthy son-in-law
that the non-realisation of his hopes seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to him like a terrible blow dealt him by Fate,
and it was long before he recovered from it.
But at last hope had sprung up once again in
his heart, although there was really no prospect
of anything for either him or his daughter.
Hildegarde's brother also looked to her for
deliverance; it surely must come one day,
and he was so deeply in debt that he could only
just keep his head above water by opportunely
winning something at cards; but that could not
go on for long. His rich relatives helped him
now and again with ¬£50 or so, but he never
dreamed of using this for paying his debts,
but usually gambled it away directly he got it.
Whenever he was in a hole he would write to
his sister: "Fulfil the hopes that are centred
upon you; save us all, and do not be so haughty
in your demands. It is true that the idea of a
middle-class brother-in-law, who has probably
never worn dress clothes and has moved in a
quite different social circle, is abhorrent to me,
still I'd put up with him if only he had money
and was willing to help us."</p>

<p>Hildegarde scarcely ever read these letters
nowadays, for she know beforehand what they
contained. Her father was in the habit of
saying exactly the same things when a bill
came to the house, or her mother asked for money
for housekeeping, or the servants demanded their
wages. He always said on such occasions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put away your aristocratic pride until you
have got a husband. There are any number
of rich middle-class men who would be only too
delighted to get for their miserable money a
beautiful and aristocratic wife who would introduce
them into Society and give them a good
social position. When you have got your husband
then you can be as aristocratic as ever
you like, in order to impress him, and the more
you show what a sacrifice you made when you
accepted him, the more he will love and honour
you."</p>

<p>Hildegarde could scarcely restrain herself from
crying out: "What am I to do? I can hardly
do anything more than allow myself to be exhibited
and admired. I can't very well actually
offer myself to the men. I am often so terribly
ashamed that I scarcely know how to endure
such a life, and what you say seems horrible to
me. I cannot understand how you can talk to
me in this way; you ought to have more respect
for your daughter than to do so. It's money,
money, everlasting money; and to pay your
debts I am to sell myself to the first best man
who offers sufficient for my body."</p>

<p>On such occasions violent speeches were on
the tip of her tongue, but she always restrained
herself, for she knew what a terrible struggle
her father had, and how he lay awake for hours
racking his brains how to make both ends meet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
When he had first left the army he had delayed
trying to get an appointment, for then he considered
it beneath his dignity to become the
agent of an insurance company or something of
the sort; now it was too late, and he was not
young enough to get work. To the end of his
life he was condemned to lead this miserable
existence of an officer who had been pensioned
early: there was neither career nor money for
him. His wife suffered almost more than he
did; she was an elegant, distinguished-looking
woman, who longed to be back in Berlin and
to share in the magnificent entertainments
where she had been so much admired. A violent
dispute had taken place between her and her
husband when he retired to the provincial town;
she would deny herself, she would put up with
all kinds of deprivations, but she longed to
breathe again the air she had formerly enjoyed.
"Only wait a year or so until Hildegarde is
married, and then we will go back again to
Berlin," her husband had said to her again and
again. And at last she had given in. At first
she had firmly resolved to live very economically
in the little town, but by degrees she was again
the distinguished and elegant woman of society
who could not alter her mode of living and her
<i>toilettes</i>. She spoke to her daughter continually
of her prospective marriage, and there were
hours when she did not scruple to reproach her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
child violently: "How is it that other young
girls, who are not nearly so beautiful and elegant
as you, get married? You must be either
very stand-offish or you must make it too apparent
that you want to get married. Both
attitudes are unsuitable."</p>

<p>Hildegarde suffered terribly from the speeches
and all the family circumstances, but she suffered
even more on account of the visits to her relatives.
It is true it was a pleasure to be in a
rich household once again, to hear nothing of
money worries; but letters from her parents
followed her to Berlin with the request that
she should borrow money for them from their
relatives. Then again the gaieties were quite
spoiled for her, because every evening before
going to bed her aunt used to say, "Has nothing
of importance happened to-day?" And even
if her aunt did not actually say this, and tried
not to let her see what she felt, Hildegarde
noticed that it was no longer a pleasure to her
aunt to take her about, for she saw the uselessness
of all her efforts, and would have preferred
her niece not to have visited her again.</p>

<p>This year Hildegarde had determined not to
go to Berlin; her pride and her vanity revolted
against being a burden to her relatives again,
and playing a despicable, yet pitiable, <i>r√¥le</i>.
She had often noticed both the contemptuous
and the sympathetic glances with which she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
been greeted when she paid calls; some people
privately joked at the idea of her not having
given up thinking about a husband, others,
knowing her straitened circumstances, felt
sympathy for her.</p>

<p>"Under no circumstances will I go to Berlin
this year," she declared to her parents. "I
am too proud and too ashamed to exhibit myself
again at all the parties, and yet get neither a
lover nor a purchaser!"</p>

<p>The dispute lasted all day long, but at last
her father, who was threatened with a warrant
for distraint on account of a wine bill for five
hundred marks, fell on his knees before her and
begged her to save him. Then at last her opposition
gave way. But she felt so wretched and miserable,
so degraded and despondent, that during
the long railway journey she constantly wept.</p>

<p>"My dear child, you have never before looked
so out of sorts; what is the matter with you?"
her aunt had asked her, and she had only been
reassured when Hildegarde feigned a violent
headache. Her aunt breathed more freely, but
next morning and the following days Hildegarde's
looks did not satisfy her, and it was
impossible to conceal the fact that she was no
longer the blooming young girl that she had
been. Her aunt looked at her sympathetically,
and more to herself than to her niece she said,
"It's high time&mdash;high time!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it certainly is," chimed in Hildegarde,
"for I cannot bear this life any longer. If I
do not get engaged this time&mdash;and I am convinced
I shall <i>not</i>&mdash;I am going to get a place as
a governess or a companion, or something of
the sort. This I know&mdash;I won't go home again."</p>

<p>"Hildegarde!" Frau von Warnow looked
with utter astonishment at her niece, who was
sitting opposite her. She was very pale, her
eyes had dark rings underneath them, there were
melancholy, despondent lines round her mouth.
"Hildegarde, do think what you are saying.
You, to take a place. You, a Wiedemann!
that is quite impossible; on our account alone
it would never do, and you must consider
us."</p>

<p>Hildegarde did not answer, but her eyes
expressed resolution and determination, and
Frau von Warnow poured forth her fears to her
husband. "Just fancy," she said, "Hildegarde
is determined that this will be the last time she
visits us, and she is capable of carrying out her
determination; if she does so, it will be a serious
reflection upon us, and people will reproach us
with not having given her enough money. They
will say, 'How can such rich people as the
Warnows allow a near relative to take a situation
and earn her own living.' People will think us
cold and lacking in all decent feeling, and will
say that even if Hildegarde could not have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
stayed at home, the proper place for her was
with us."</p>

<p>Captain von Warnow looked indignant, and
as a sign of his vexation he thrust out his underlip
and twisted and twirled his faultlessly-pointed
moustaches. "My dear Clara, pray spare me
these matters; settle the affair with Hildegarde.
I have more important things to think about&mdash;in
a few days the major will be present at the
drill, and, as you know, it may go off all right,
but it may <i>not</i>."</p>

<p>"Quite so," his wife agreed. He did not
perceive the irony of her words.</p>

<p>"Ah! I am glad you see that; then you
will understand that at present I am more
interested in the success of my men than whether
Hildegarde accepts a post or not. You understand,
don't you?"</p>

<p>His wife quite understood. For a long time
her husband had been somewhat tired of acting
as guardian to Hildegarde. He was very fond
of her, but her family got on his nerves; he hated
those perpetual begging-letters, but he always
gave money, partly out of affection for his niece,
partly because he felt he owed it to his position.
He could not bear the idea of his cousin, whose
ancestors had been distinguished in the Thirty
Years' War, being summoned by a tradesman;
such a thing was out of the question. He would
have much preferred that his wife had never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
taken upon herself the difficult task of getting
Hildegarde married, for then he need not have
been brought into close connection with her
family. He could not help it, but whenever
he received a letter from the Wiedemanns he
felt as if he were dealing with something that
was not quite clean, and as soon as ever he had
read the letter he washed his carefully-looked-after
hands with great ceremony.</p>

<p>Frau von Warnow was very much perturbed
about Hildegarde; she could not possibly be
allowed to take a situation; that would compromise
them too much: at the same time she
did not want her to live with them. There
was only one way out of the difficulty; Hildegarde
must get engaged during the coming
season, but the question was&mdash;to whom? The
night before her entertainment Frau von Warnow
lay awake, turning over in her mind as to who
should take Hildegarde in to dinner, and it was
only toward morning that a happy thought
occurred to her. It was such a simple one that
she could not understand why it had not occurred
to her before. Winkler, of course, must marry
Hildegarde, and at breakfast she disclosed her
plan to her niece, who listened to it with indifference;
this man or that was just the same to
her if she could be rescued from her miserable
family circumstances, her wretched poverty,
and was not obliged to hear the oft-repeated and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
monotonous reproaches flung at her head. A
quiet, resigned smile played on her finely-cut
lips. "So this time the deliverer was called
Winkler. I should much like to know what
he looks like, though probably to you that is a
matter of no importance. Is he nice?"</p>

<p>Frau von Warnow was somewhat embarrassed
for a moment. "I don't know him yet."</p>

<p>"And yet you recommend him to me as a
husband?" The words breathed irony and
bitterness.</p>

<p>Frau von Warnow quickly recovered her
presence of mind. "What do you want? He
is very rich, his father is said to be a millionaire,
he's simply made for you. Have I never spoken
to you about him? Didn't I? Well, I suppose
I forgot his name. One has as a rule,
thank heaven, so little to do with these middle-class
persons that one does not trouble to remember
their names. Winkler, however, belongs
to our regiment, he is in my husband's company;
you know Eric's views concerning middle-class
officers, but he is obliged to admit that this
Winkler performs his duties most satisfactorily,
and that probably in the course of a few years
he will have won promotion. For Eric to say
that is the highest praise. Up to the present,
as you can quite understand, he has remained
a rank outsider, although he must have been
quite six months in the regiment, for social<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
prejudices cannot be cast on one side so quickly.
Winkler has a difficult position here; if you
became engaged to him everything would be
altered in a moment&mdash;he would then be distantly
connected with us; through you he would
belong to one of the most distinguished families,
and as your <i>fianc√©</i> he would not only be invited
by the most exclusive people, but&mdash;how exactly
can I express it?&mdash;he would be made quite at
home among them."</p>

<p>The last words were uttered with some difficulty
by Frau von Warnow, and she was not quite
honest in what she said. She knew, indeed, that
she herself would never look upon Lieutenant
Winkler as a relative, and that all the other
aristocratic families would regard the marriage
as a <i>mesalliance</i>; they would either not receive
him at all, or confine themselves to entirely
formal intercourse and the exchange of the
necessary courtesies. But that was a matter
of entire indifference; the important thing was
to provide for Hildegarde.</p>

<p>Frau von Warnow was silent for a moment.
She was quite exhausted by her long speech;
then she turned to her niece and said: "Well,
what do you think of my plan?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde said nothing; what would have
been the use of saying, "It is hateful to get
engaged to a man in this way; a man whom
I do not know, whom I have never seen, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
therefore I cannot tell whether I should like him
or not." Her aunt was so occupied with her
project that she did not notice Hildegarde's
silence, she did not even wait for her answer,
but said, "Of course, therefore, Lieutenant
Winkler will take you in to dinner."</p>

<p>"But will it not look odd if I go in to dinner
with an officer who has so lately entered the
regiment when several of the older men will
not be able to take in a lady?"</p>

<p>Frau von Warnow bit her lips with vexation.
Hildegarde was quite right. She must not
allow her project to be too apparent, and after
a moment's thought she said:</p>

<p>"Yes, that won't do, certainly. Baron von
Masemann must take you in to dinner, and
Winkler must sit on the other side of you. As he
comes to our house to-day for the first time and
belongs to Eric's company, it will not attract
attention if I give him a specially good place
at dinner. Moreover, I intend to say a few
friendly words to him before all the other guests.
Perhaps, even, I shall get Eric to welcome him
in a little speech."</p>

<p>But Eric objected. "That's going a little
too far. I couldn't justify myself to my comrades
if I did that, and I should arouse a violent
protest. I cannot avoid asking Winkler to my
house as he belongs to the regiment and is an
officer in my company; but to toast him&mdash;to-day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
when, with the exception of the servants, he is
the only middle-class man in our house&mdash;that is
out of the question."</p>

<p>Von Warnow was, indeed, absolutely opposed
to his wife's plan of betrothing Hildegarde to
Lieutenant Winkler.</p>

<p>"Winkler a connection of mine! No, thank
you. Later, I suppose, I shall have to be on
quite intimate terms with the fellow. It would
be far better for Hildegarde not to marry at all
than to marry a plebeian."</p>

<p>He walked up and down the room indignantly,
and only recovered his composure when his
wife, quite against her real feeling in the matter,
for she already saw the bridal pair standing
at the altar, said:</p>

<p>"You jump to a conclusion too quickly.
When that happens we can consider the matter."</p>

<p>The entrance of the servants, who had still
many preparations to make for the entertainment,
brought the conversation to an end, and it was
now quite time to dress. So the husband and
wife did not meet again till the first carriage
rolled up to the door.</p>

<p>"Wherever is Hildegarde?"</p>

<p>At last she appeared, just as the first guests
arrived. She looked charming in her cream
robe, though there was a somewhat tired and
anxious look upon her face.</p>

<p>Carriage after carriage rolled up to the door,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and the spacious reception-rooms were soon filled.
All the guests knew one another and were frequent
visitors at the Warnows, and conversation was
soon in full swing. Most of them had not seen
each other during the summer, and there were no
end of questions as to where they had been
during the holidays. They talked about the
prospective gaieties of the season, of the court
festivities, the programme of which had just
appeared.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Winkler was apparently the last
to arrive. He had purposely come late so that
he might be introduced to the whole assembly
at one and the same moment. He knew scarcely
any of the ladies, for only the least important
of them had included him in their visiting list.
Was it by chance or intentionally that just as
he came into the room dead silence reigned?
George noticed that the ladies suddenly broke
off their conversation and looked at him coldly.
For a brief moment he was embarrassed, for
even the lady of the house was unknown to him.
Which was she? Then Frau von Warnow came
towards him, and Lieutenant Winkler took a
step forward and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>"You are heartily welcome, Lieutenant
Winkler. I am delighted to see you among us."</p>

<p>Everybody heard the words as Frau von
Warnow had desired, and so nobody would be
astonished later on if she were somewhat specially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
attentive to him. She exchanged a few words
with the lieutenant, and then she introduced him
to the ladies. Last of all she turned to her niece.</p>

<p>"Dear Hildegarde, allow me to introduce to
you Lieutenant Winkler."</p>

<p>Hildegarde had purposely kept in the background.
She had even attempted to avoid the
introduction. It was disagreeable to her even
to approach a man whom they had just been
discussing in such a way that morning, and
she could scarcely conceal her embarrassment.
George did not observe this. He bowed and
went into the corridor to take off his helmet
and scarf. Hildegarde breathed more freely.
Thank heaven! the first meeting was over,
and she made up her mind to devote herself
to the man who took her in to dinner and not
trouble about Lieutenant Winkler. But when
they went into the dining-room and took their
places at the table, beautifully decorated with
freshly-gathered flowers, Hildegarde saw, only
too soon, that during the year in which she had
not seen her companion he had not become
more amusing or wittier. Baron von Masemann
belonged to a very ancient family and was a
conscientious officer, but otherwise he was a
nonentity. All his efforts were directed towards
being considered the best-mannered man among
a set of well-mannered men, and this was a somewhat
difficult task in a regiment that numbered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
counts and barons. Thus he felt it behoved him,
by his whole behaviour and bearing not to
abrogate his dignity in the slightest degree.
He was haughty and reserved because he considered
this to be well bred, and he spoke little,
for he thought an aristocrat should speak little
but observe much. So now at the dinner-table
he merely inquired of his companion in the politest
possible manner how she had been during the
long period when he had not had the pleasure
of seeing her. He asked her how long she meant
to stay in Berlin, and when he had received
this information, which did not in the least
interest him, he considered he had done his duty.
He remained silent, and when Hildegarde tried
to entertain her companion he listened with an
artificial air of interest, and as a sign that he was
paying attention to her he now and again threw
in a "Yes" or "No," or other equally striking
remarks.</p>

<p>"Baroness, would you be so good as to pass
the sauce-tureen?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde, with an "Excuse me," turned
to her right and took the bowl from George to
pass it to her neighbour on the left.</p>

<p>"May I trouble you again?" Once more
she turned to the right and looked at George
for the first time; until now she had studiously
avoided him, and she was astonished at the
intelligent expression and the seriousness of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
character which his eyes revealed; there was
nothing of the Guardsman about him, for their
only ambition was to appear <i>blas√©</i> and amusing.
Another thing about him pleased her: that
was the look of genuine admiration and respect
with which he regarded her. She noticed that
he was attracted to her, and that her beauty
made a deep impression upon him; she was
extremely pleased to find that, unlike most
young lieutenants, he had not begun by paying
violent court to her, and acting the part of the
irresistible male who has only to use his eyes to
attract every girl to him.</p>

<p>"Appearances may be deceptive, of course,"
thought Hildegarde, "but I have picked up a
good deal of knowledge of human nature during
the last few years, and if I am not mistaken
this is a good and sensible man." She suddenly
became desirous of talking to him. Apparently
he had not the courage to address her, perhaps
he did not know what to say to her a complete
stranger, so she must begin the conversation.
It occurred to her that she might try and win
the young officer's heart, and also his money,
so that at last she might rescue her parents and
brother from their dire poverty.</p>

<p>A crimson flush mounted to her cheeks, and
she bent low over the plate so that he might
not observe it. Lieutenant Winkler misinterpreted
her embarrassment and said frankly:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
"I beg your pardon, if my glances have perturbed
you in any way. As excuse I can only
say that never before have I seen so much beauty
and grace united in one person; I had no intention
of making you feel uncomfortable."</p>

<p>The words sounded so frank and honourable;
but far from having the desired effect, they
produced just the contrary feeling; once again
the blood rushed to her cheeks, for she felt she
was playing a poor part towards this young
officer. At last she recovered her composure,
and with an attempt at badinage, she said:
"What, you begin to pay compliments before
the champagne comes! still, one can't help
liking them when they are expressed so pleasantly."</p>

<p>"I am so glad that you are not angry with
me," was his reply.</p>

<p>And now that the ice was once broken they
began to chatter to each other. George possessed
the gift of conversation to a high degree as
Hildegarde soon noticed; he had a very pleasant
voice, and this added to her pleasure in listening
to him. From every word that he spoke she
could see that he was a thoroughly cultivated
man, who had studied much and took an interest
in a great many subjects. In knowledge and
general intelligence he was certainly far superior
to his companions. "If I had not gone into the
army I should have studied political economy,"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
he said in the course of conversation. "My
father has a large manufactory and employs
countless workmen; he is unceasingly occupied
in trying to improve their social and material
position; he sees that they have cheap and
good dwellings; he has built libraries, given
play-grounds and open-air spaces for the children;
in short, he has done all that was possible
to improve their condition. Of course, my father
has talked to me about all these things; he
gave me all sorts of books to read, and explained
what I could not understand. As I said to you,
if I had not gone into the army I should have
interested myself in the social question."</p>

<p>"Why did you go into the army, and are
you satisfied with your career?"</p>

<p>He answered her second question only. "I
have now been six years in the army, and cannot
say with a simple 'Yes' or 'No' whether
my military duties will satisfy me permanently.
Naturally, I hope and believe they will, but if
later I see I have made a mistake, then I shall
leave the service, and take over the management
of the factory, for my father has given me
a completely free hand. Of course, what I do
in the future naturally depends upon whether
I get promotion in the regiment as you will
understand without any further explanations
from me."</p>

<p>He skilfully turned the conversation to another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
subject and told her more about the factory.
Hildegarde listened with great interest, for
everything that she heard was quite new to her.
She had not the faintest conception of the life
and labour of other people, and until then had
never indeed thought about such things. In
the circles in which she moved people either
lived on their money or regarded work more or
less from the point of view of suitability to a
person's birth, or they lived as <i>grand seigneurs</i>
in poor circumstances, and regarded it as beneath
their dignity to work for money.</p>

<p>The time passed very quickly; Hildegarde
confined her attentions to George, and forgot
all about Baron von Masemann. The latter
made several attempts to address some feeble
remarks to her, but when he saw that she went
on talking to George he closed his mouth tight.
He generally occupied himself at dinner with
observing carefully how his younger companions
behaved and whether their manners and behaviour
at dinner called for any report. This
was his speciality, and on account of this he
was feared, for there was scarcely any entertainment
which did not give him an occasion for
rebuking his comrades next day. As he was
considered a great authority on etiquette, people
were really very grateful for his instructions,
but unfortunately he had a terribly sarcastic
and ironical way of delivering his words of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
wisdom, which irritated the younger officers far
more than a torrent of abusive words.</p>

<p>Hildegarde looked up quite astonished when
she suddenly saw that the guests were rising.
How often had she not longed for the dinner to
end when she had sat by the side of a lieutenant
who told her about his stupid recruits or stale
stories which had no connection with one another.
Now, on the contrary, she was sorry that the
dinner was over.</p>

<p>A little dance concluded the entertainment,
and it was towards midnight when the guests
departed. Scarcely had the last gone when
Frau von Warnow embraced her niece warmly.
"Hildegarde, I am happy. I was continually
watching you two at dinner and during the
dance. Lieutenant Winkler couldn't take his
eyes off you. Mark my words, this time the
thing will come off; it was easy to see that
the man was infatuated with you. To-morrow
I shall write to your father."</p>

<p>These words affected Hildegarde like a stream
of cold water. For the first time for many a
long day she had really enjoyed a party, and
during the pleasant conversation she had quite
forgotten her parents and her own miserable
circumstances; now that the whole thing stood
out clearly in her mind she was utterly depressed.</p>

<p>"Remember what I say, Hildegarde, in less
than three months you will be engaged. If you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
had always been as amiable and friendly to men
as you were to-day to Lieutenant Winkler you
would have been married long ago. Well, to-day
you played your cards well; Winkler is
certainly in love with you."</p>

<p>If Hildegarde had received a blow on the
forehead she could not have felt it more than
these words. During the course of the evening
she had completely forgotten her aunt's project
with regard to Lieutenant Winkler, and now
she was accused of trying to ensnare him, and
this insulting insinuation was regarded by her
aunt as the highest praise. An indignant answer
half rose to her lips, but as usual she restrained
herself. She had long ago given up trying to
justify herself; her aunt would not have believed
her, she would not indeed have understood
it.</p>

<p>She was delighted when at last she could go
to her own room, where she burst into a flood
of passionate tears. She was conscious of having
done nothing wrong, and yet she felt as if she
would like to sink into the earth for shame.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
  <span class="smcap">A Game of Cards</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was some weeks later. The fifth company
came on guard at mid-day and George was on
garrison duty. He was in an extremely bad
temper, for he had just been obliged to give a
piece of his mind to a sub-lieutenant, named
Nissew, who was a great favourite of Captain
von Warnow. The captain was most particular
that there should be no swearing while on duty,
and he required his subordinates to act as perfect
gentlemen. George had long perceived that
this was ridiculous; he himself detested blows,
ill-treatment and brutality towards inferiors,
but on the other hand he knew quite well that
at the right moment a few strong words worked
wonders. You couldn't manage otherwise in
the army; the men indeed expected that now
and again a sounding curse should descend on
their heads. But the captain was so excessively
polite that he indeed would like to have addressed
his men as "Herr So-and-so!" The men of
course laughed at their superior behind his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
back, and in George's opinion the company did
not work nearly hard enough. The Poles and
East Prussians in his former regiment had been
far more active and well-drilled soldiers, it
seemed to him, than these troops on parade,
who were handled with silk gloves. The under
officers naturally followed in their captain's
footsteps, partly because they agreed with him,
but largely from an instinct of self-preservation,
for Herr von Warnow ruthlessly got rid of
any subordinate who had once earned his anger
by cursing or swearing. To George the most
disagreeable of all the inferior officers was von
Nissew, a one-year service man, who on account
of his noble birth was regarded as an <i>enfant gat√©</i>
by the captain, and was later to be made a
sergeant-major; he was a time-server of the
worst kind, was always faultlessly dressed, and
his outward appearance made a very good impression.
George did not know how it was,
but from the very first day he had taken a dislike
to him; he distrusted his cunning grey eyes,
and it was extremely unpleasant to him that
just this particular officer should be placed in
his company, to a certain extent to give him
instructions, and to be able to say to him, "Captain
von Warnow desires that such and such a
thing should be done."</p>

<p>George did not like the way in which he treated
his men. Nissew was always almost exaggeratedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
polite to his inferiors, yet somehow in his words
there sounded a secret threat. George had
often noticed how the people trembled before
his piercing, scrutinising glance. This very day
he had been struck by something; the sub-lieutenant
was giving instructions to a man who
had on several occasions made a bad appearance
on parade duty, apparently with the greatest
politeness, but his glance had augured nothing
good. When George had turned away he heard
the officer whisper to the man, "Before you go
on guard come to me. I want to say a word to
you, and arouse your sense of honour." The
soldier turned pale, and George had thereupon
called the officer aside. He knew the meaning
of that expression "arouse a feeling of honour,"
he knew that it was generally accompanied with
blows and curses. He said as much to the sub-lieutenant,
forbade him to summon the man,
and exhorted him earnestly to do nothing that
was not allowed. Nissew assumed an utterly
astonished and injured expression. How could
Lieutenant Winkler think such a thing about
him? He had never done anything wrong.
Captain von Warnow knew that perfectly well,
and therefore he had given him permission,
once for all, to call the men to account if they
did not do their duty satisfactorily. The sub-lieutenant
walked off with a highly-injured
expression, and George knew that immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the captain came he would be rebuked because
he had dared to cast doubts on his subordinate.</p>

<p>And so it was. Captain von Warnow saw
immediately that something was the matter
with his favourite, and asked him what it was.
Nissew knew perfectly well that he could only
make a complaint of his lieutenant after twenty-four
hours had elapsed, if he were not to render
himself liable to punishment. So at first he
hesitated, but at the direct command of his
superior he related what had happened, but he
related it in such a way that though it purported
to be merely a description, it was really a complaint
of the insult he had just received. Herr
von Warnow listened silently, then he said:
"I must speak to Lieutenant Winkler." He
spoke severely to him. "It has often seemed
to me, Lieutenant Winkler, that you are suspicious
and distrustful of Sub-Lieutenant Nissew;
I can assure you he is one of the best officers in
my company. You have only known him for
six months. I have known him for three years.
He has never given me the slightest occasion to
reprimand him, but his zeal and enthusiasm for
his military duties will suffer if you are continually
worrying him, and it must deeply wound
him if you really think him capable of such
shameful behaviour, as ill-treatment of the
soldiers certainly is. I beg you to consider my
words very seriously."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>When, therefore, George returned to his own
division it was extremely disagreeable to him
to have to share duties with Nissew; he saw
quite clearly the malicious glance that he now
and again gave him on the sly, and yet he had to
act as if he saw nothing. He had no desire to
rebuke him a second time, and to be rebuked
himself a second time; the relations between
him and his captain had so far been tolerably
pleasant. He did not want to destroy them
intentionally. "Whatever does it matter to
me?" he said to himself at last; "after all,
it is not I who am responsible for the men but
the captain, and if he thinks his lieutenant the
epitome of perfection it is all right."</p>

<p>He therefore determined not to trouble himself
any more about his subordinate, and after a
few weeks he discovered that this was the most
sensible thing to do. Captain von Warnow
had inquired whether he left Nissew alone,
and when the latter replied in the affirmative he
became quite friendly with George again.</p>

<p>As far as his military duties were concerned,
George got on very well; his men had been
praised on inspection parade, his drill during
the winter had been considered good, and the
performance of his duties as an officer had been
well spoken of. He was really an excellent
officer; his appearance on parade, his personal
bearing and his behaviour to his subordinates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
gave occasion for no adverse criticism; he was
strict and honourable, and impartial in his
treatment. Thus he soon won the respect of
his men, and when one day his orderly fell ill,
and the sergeant-major asked who would voluntarily
act as Lieutenant Winkler's servant, almost
the whole company offered. Even Captain von
Warnow was pleased when he heard this, and
his men's behaviour filled George with justifiable
satisfaction; it was a delightful feeling to him
to know that he had been able to win his men's
affection to such an extent.</p>

<p>Officially things were going on well with
George, but socially he was no better off than
on the first day he had entered the regiment.
He was obliged to confess himself that he had
not advanced one step. It was certainly not
his fault. He was not extravagant in his mode
of life, he was modest in his behaviour, courteous
towards his elders, and from a remark he had
heard by chance he knew that his comrades
thought highly of him for not being ostentatious
with his money, and for "messing" just as they
did.</p>

<p>George had made several attempts and had
really exerted himself to try and get to know
some of his comrades better, to discover their
true character, and find out whether the distant
and reserved air that they always wore was a
mask, or corresponded to their real nature. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
this particular respect he was specially interested
in his colleague in the company, Baron von
Masemann. Even in intercourse with his contemporaries
he acted as if he were at court. An
artificial restrained air reigned at meals, so
George thought; they talked a good deal, of
course, but there was no harmless fun, no unconstrained
merriment. George was horribly bored.
They only talked court gossip and told pointless
stories which could only have interest for the
others because they referred to the most aristocratic
circles; and as George did not even know
the names of most of the families mentioned,
the conversation was absolutely uninteresting
to him. Not a single serious subject was ever
touched upon; George contented himself with
the part of listener, and thus as he found little
opportunity of joining in the conversation he
did not get any more intimate with his comrades.</p>

<p>In the regiment the officers had gradually
accepted the unalterable fact that George was
to be one of them, but that was all. If they no
longer shed tears because he was there, still
they could not pretend they were pleased; they
were quite polite to him, but they erected these
social barriers which excluded all confidence
and intimacy. Thus it came about that George
had not a single friend in the regiment. All
maintained a certain reserve towards him, more
especially his contemporaries, though George<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
had shown himself friendly in all his relations
with them. Curiously, the most haughty among
them all was the one who attracted him most.
This was Lieutenant von Willberg, the one who
had burst into tears when he heard of George's
transference. He was possessed of an incredible
pride, but he had his saner moments, as George
called them, and then he was a lovable, happy,
delightful creature; his adorable youthful light-heartedness
showed itself, and then George quite
understood how, in spite of everything, in spite
of the warp in his nature, little Willberg was the
darling and the pet of the regiment. George did
not know how Willberg had felt about his coming
into the regiment, and he had often wished to know
him better, but so far the opportunity had not
yet offered itself.</p>

<p>One day when George came into barracks he
found a large company assembled there. Various
guests had been invited, comrades from other
regiments, mostly Cavalry officers. Of course
the guests sat at the upper end of the table
with the older officers of the "Golden Butterflies,"
and it was not without envy that those
sitting at the lower end of the table regarded
them. Even the Guards-Infantry were impressed
by the Hussars and Uhlans, for the Cavalry
officers were considered the most distinguished
body in the army. Everybody saw how delighted
the "Golden Butterflies" were to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
their distinguished guests among them. They
vied with each other in amiability, and even the
elder chiefs and some of the younger staff officers,
who were bachelors and daily dined together
in the mess-room, made no concealment of the
pleasure the visit gave and how honoured they
felt. When they all rose from the table to take
their coffee and cigars in the smoking-room,
the guests were invited to take the large comfortable
easy chairs, and the "Golden Butterflies"
stood around them in a semi-circle. Each
tried to gain the notice of the Cavalry officers
and to be very attentive to them. To be invited
to dine by the Cavalry Guard was a distinction
for which all strove; for only when one had
dined with them was one considered quite "tip-top";
the officers of the Guards accepted invitations
from allied regiments, but they themselves
were excessively careful in the choice of
their guests. Little Willberg literally flung himself
at their heads. He stood near Baron Gersbach,
whose people came from his own district,
and played the part of the darling of the regiment,
and tried to engage his guests in an interesting
conversation. Apparently this did not make
the least impression upon the Uhlan, who
stretched out his legs, and carelessly smoked
one cigar after the other.</p>

<p>But little Willberg was most anxious to impress
the Uhlan in some way or other, if not as a pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
companion then as a clever, sharp-witted fellow,
and so he said to him: "How would it be if
we had a game of cards?"</p>

<p>They spoke quite openly in the barracks about
card-playing. It is true it was forbidden, and
indeed at regular intervals the most stringent
orders against playing for money were publicly
read out, and listened to with that respect which
is proper for commands emanating from such
high places, but further than this no one troubled
about the prohibition. The military authorities
knew all about it, but they shut their eyes, and
indeed it sometimes happened that the colonels
themselves played with their own officers. What
could the military authorities do? In a little
garrison town it was easy enough to see that
an order was carried out, but in a large town it
was utterly impossible. The officers would play,
and if they were not allowed to play in the
barracks or the mess-room, then they would
gamble in some club or in another regiment or
in their own homes. Whoever means to gamble
will find an opportunity. Officially of course,
it was said, officers are not allowed to gamble;
but one must distinguish between gambling and
gambling. If a fellow lost twenty marks it
didn't matter to anybody, and if he lost a hundred,
what did it matter? And if a man has
the misfortune to lose a thousand marks surely
he isn't more liable to punishment than if he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
had only staked twenty? If the military authorities
intended to punish everybody who touched
a pack of cards, then the number of officers in
any one year would be reduced by half. The
lieutenants who played would, of course, be
punished, and the colonels in whose regiments
gambling went on would run the risk of dismissal
because they had not seen that the stringent
regulations concerning gambling were carried
out. Now, a man who is a colonel naturally
wishes to become a general, and he is not likely
to risk his military reputation by giving information
which he can suppress if he likes.</p>

<p>Little Willberg repeated the question which
the Uhlan at first thought it beneath his dignity
to answer. At last he looked at him somewhat
astonished: "You had better take care, you
will lose your money; are you so very rich that
you don't mind losing it?"</p>

<p>Willberg slapped his pockets cheekily:
"They're quite full to-day, I've just had a
remittance."</p>

<p>Willberg could not account for it, but suddenly
he had an odd feeling. It had taken a long
time to squeeze a thousand marks out of his
old father to pay some of his most pressing debts.
He had therefore the feeling that it was not
quite right to risk any on a game of cards, but
he would rather have died than confessed it
now. Had he done so he would have for ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
blamed himself and made himself supremely
ridiculous in the sight of those beautiful patent-leather
boots and silver spurs, which were the
things that impressed him most in the Uhlan.
However, he determined not to risk more than
half of his cash; if he lost that, then the affair
was over, if he won, then he would reconsider
matters.</p>

<p>Baron Gersbach was known as a great gambler,
and it was an open secret that it was only through
gambling that he managed to keep his head
above water. He had long ago spent his inheritance,
and did not receive a penny beyond his
pay, and yet his pockets were always full of
bank-notes. Many people wondered why he
was allowed to remain in the army. It was said
that he enjoyed the protection of those high in
authority. The story went that even his superior
officers and men of the highest rank had played
with him. Curiously enough he was an excellent
officer, and an exceedingly good rider, who
had often distinguished himself at the races.
He might almost have been called a professional
gambler, though he was known to gamble perfectly
honourably and straightforwardly. He
did not gamble every day, but only from time
to time, when he was driven to make a great
<i>coup</i>, but even then he only touched cards when
an inward voice told him: "To-day you will
win." If he was not quite sure about this, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
could not be induced to join in a game of cards;
thus, whenever he played he won, and people
were really astonished that he could ever find
anyone who was willing to lose his money to
the baron. But, of course, each of them hoped
that his case would prove the exception, and so
again and again men were willing to risk their
luck. All those who had not already played
with him regarded it as a great distinction to
be invited to do so, and indeed anybody who
had not played with Baron Gersbach at least
once, was considered not quite the thing.</p>

<p>They did not begin to play cards, to a certain
extent from politeness, until the staff officers
had left the room. One of the majors indeed
found it extremely difficult to go, for he was
an inveterate gambler and would gladly have
stayed behind; everybody was quite aware of
this. Still he really owed something to his
position; he could not very well win money
from his subalterns&mdash;at any rate not in barracks&mdash;that
wouldn't do at all.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they left the room when all
constraint was abandoned, and George observed
his comrades with considerable astonishment.
They had often played cards in his presence,
but he had never seen them like this before; it
was the first time that they had cast on one side
their air of elaborate repose and faultlessly
correct behaviour. It seemed as if an evil spirit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
had taken possession of them, a mad intoxication,
the passion for gambling had seized upon
them all, they were nervous and excited. They
were all asking themselves whether they were
going to win or lose, one saw it by the excitement
in their eyes, their pale faces, the nervous
twitching of their hands.</p>

<p>Only one man was absolutely calm, and that
was the Uhlan. With his legs wide apart, he
sat leaning back on the sofa, and did not trouble
himself in the least degree about the preparations
for the game. Whether he was inwardly
as calm as he looked, who could say? Outwardly,
at any rate, he did not betray the faintest
excitement.</p>

<p>At last the card-table was all ready, and the
adjutant of the regiment, Count Wettborn,
turned to Baron Gersbach and said: "Well,
what do you say, shall we have a game of cards?"</p>

<p>Much depended on the Uhlan's reply, for if
he had said "No," the whole thing would have
been quite different; they would just have had
a harmless, pleasant little game. But to-day the
Uhlan was in the right mood for playing&mdash;to-day
on getting up he had felt cheerful and happy,
and an inward voice had told him: "To-day
you can again risk a large sum of money." In
spite of this, however, the cautious creature had
said to himself: "If my Leda gets over the
hurdles to-day without breaking her neck, I will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
risk it," and his Leda had jumped over them
three times like a darling. He had looked into
his carefully-kept diary to see which regiments
he had not visited for a long time; his choice
fell on the "Golden Butterflies," and he was
glad, for they would pay a couple of thousands
for the honour of his visit without murmuring
and grumbling. So he telephoned to the adjutant
to ask if he might dine with them and bring
a couple of his good friends with him. Count
Wettborn was not a particularly intelligent
person, but he quite understood the meaning
of the message, and as he himself was a keen
gambler, he was only too delighted to say yes.</p>

<p>With inimitable nonchalance the Uhlan got
up from the sofa and sank down into a chair
which his attentive friends placed for him.
Then he dived into his pockets and brought out
his pocket-book, and the others noticed with a
certain amount of misgiving the roll of bank-notes
that bulged out. They remembered the
true principle of all gambling; you can only
win at cards if you have a large amount of capital,
and can hold out when the luck is against you.
The Uhlan had the necessary capital, and who
therefore could hope to win against him? Then
the adjutant, Count Wettborn, put his pocket-book
on the table, and the "Golden Butterflies"
were extremely proud when they saw his purse;
it was a little heirloom which he always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
carried about with him, for the count belonged
to a very rich family, besides which, he was
heir to an uncle who often gave him large sums
of money.</p>

<p>"Really, our adjutant's a fine fellow," whispered
one "Golden Butterfly" to another.
"We really have a right to be proud of him:
from the crown of his head to the soles of his
feet he's tip-top. I believe even the Cavalry
officers envy us him."</p>

<p>The other players dipped into their pockets;
some who carried their money in bank-notes in
pocket-books, more or less ostentatiously, whilst
others who kept their possessions in a purse,
furtively drew out a few gold coins&mdash;at the
game of "Sieben" the stake began at twenty
marks.</p>

<p>Little Willberg took out his ¬£50 bank-note.
Although he was heavily in debt he felt very
proud of his possessions; and as he walked
through the streets of the city he had held himself
erect and lofty, thinking that everyone
must see that he had a ¬£50 bank-note with him.
He had felt very rich then, but now in comparison
with the sums that glittered forth from the
others' purses, he seemed miserably poor; he
was ashamed of his limited means, and was filled
with envy and ill-will. It was a miserable and
deplorable state of affairs always to be obliged
to bother about money, and to have to say to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
oneself: "You mustn't do this and that," and
to be perpetually forced to borrow. It would
be glorious, even if only for once, to possess a
purse full of money; above all, to be able to
carry about bank-notes&mdash;that would be really
too exquisite for anything. If one were stationed
in an out-of-the-way little garrison, of course it
wouldn't matter whether one had much or little
money; but in Berlin, where one mixed with so
many distinguished rich people, like those who
were their guests to-day, then it was indeed a
miserable thing to possess nothing but one
wretched ¬£50 note!</p>

<p>The game had gone on for a long time&mdash;the
Uhlan kept the bank. "Well, Willberg, won't
you stake something? you were so impatient
to play a little while ago."</p>

<p>Willberg roused himself; he had been deep
in thought; the gold that was clinking on all
sides glimmered before him, he had only one
wish, one thought to possess it all.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course I will play. A hundred
marks on the seven&mdash;no, two hundred." A
second later and he had lost the money.</p>

<p>"Two hundred again." He lost that.</p>

<p>"Two hundred again." This time he had
good luck, and fourteen hundred marks were
counted out to him. Again the seven came to
him, he had staked four hundred upon it, and
so he won back nearly three thousand marks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Willberg was astonished; he felt as if
he had done a wonderful thing. Even the
Uhlan cast upon him a glance of recognition,
and when he had paid him his winnings, gave
him a hearty "bravo." This praise made Willberg
so proud that he immediately staked four
hundred marks upon the seven, and lost it.</p>

<p>George had looked on at the game for a considerable
time without taking any share in it,
now he began to tire of it, and thought he would
quietly retire. He went through the reading-room,
when someone suddenly called him by
name, and when he turned round he saw the
first lieutenant, von Kirchberg, in an easy chair.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he asked him.</p>

<p>George felt he was caught, for it was not considered
the correct thing to go off in this fashion,
but he said nevertheless, "I meant to go home."</p>

<p>The other looked up astonished. "Have you
come to the end of your tether? Have you lost
all your money, then?"</p>

<p>"I never play, sir."</p>

<p>"What!" the other almost dropped his eyeglass
in his astonishment, and looked at George
for a long time speechless. "What!" he said
once more, then he continued: "Come here
and sit by me&mdash;you must tell me&mdash;how you
manage to get along without playing cards,
or rather how can you resist the temptation!"</p>

<p>"That's not a difficulty for me, sir, gambling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
has absolutely no attraction for me. A couple
of years ago I was at Monte Carlo, and watched
the gambling for hours together, but I never
had the slightest desire to stake a penny."</p>

<p>"What, really!" Again the other looked
at him as if such ideas were beyond his comprehension.
"Really, I can't understand it. What
then do you do with your money if you don't
play cards?"</p>

<p>"What I don't spend during the month I
put into the bank."</p>

<p>"Well, but what's the use of that&mdash;I mean
what's the fun of it? Why don't you spend all
your money? You're not a tradesman but a
young lieutenant. Well, all I know is, that if I
had your money I shouldn't put any in the bank."</p>

<p>"I say, Kirchberg, wherever have you hidden
yourself?" said a comrade who just then came
into the room. "We are still playing <i>Half-part</i>:
the first lot of capital has gone to the
devil. Have you got any money about you?"</p>

<p>"Is the Uhlan still winning?"</p>

<p>The other scratched his ears. "Yes, horribly."</p>

<p>Kirchberg lit another cigar. "Then we will
first let him get to the end of his tether. Let
him first win other people's ducats, and then
we'll try to win them back again. Who is at
the present moment in his toils?"</p>

<p>"Little Willberg. The fellow's had extraordinary
luck to-day; he stakes each time on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
seven, which has been thrown down five times
in succession. He's just revelling in gold, and
the Uhlan naturally wants to win back the
money."</p>

<p>"Is Willberg calm?"</p>

<p>"How could he possibly be? He's trembling
with excitement in all his limbs."</p>

<p>"What a pity! for then all's up with him.
However, I want to see the thing."</p>

<p>He got up and went back into the card-room,
and almost involuntarily George followed him.
He felt as if he wanted to help Willberg, to
whisper in his ear, "Be prudent; stop in time;
put your winnings in your pocket; you have
plenty for the present."</p>

<p>But Willberg had not the least intention of
stopping. For a start the luck had been against
him, but now he won time after time. The other
officers had long ceased to play and were watching
these two. Willberg was excited and nervous,
feverish and trembling. The Uhlan, on the
contrary, was absolutely calm, immovable as
brass; not an eye-lash quivered, and his hand
did not tremble in the slightest degree when he
pushed over the winnings to his antagonist.
He had to count out huge sums of money. The
amount that he had won as banker had long
vanished; the bank-notes which he had brought
from home had dwindled down to a tiny heap.
Gold and paper money was heaped up in front<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
of Willberg, probably to the amount of about
twenty thousand marks.</p>

<p>The Uhlan counted out his money. "I can
stake for the last time a thousand marks on the
seven. If I lose and have to pay out seven
thousand marks, I shall break the bank."</p>

<p>An indescribable excitement took possession
of them all. Never before had they seen the
Uhlan lose so much, and the "Golden Butterflies"
were filled with pride that one of their officers
should have caused this extraordinary state of
things.</p>

<p>The last stake! The seven had so often
brought Willberg good luck, surely it would
stay with him to the end.</p>

<p>"A thousand marks on the seven."</p>

<p>The banker shuffled the cards. "Eight!"
and he shovelled in the money.</p>

<p>"A thousand on the seven again."</p>

<p>The cards showed the six! For one moment
the Uhlan's eyes glittered. Now he knew he had
won the game. It could not last more than a
quarter of an hour, for he had won back all he
had lost. It really would have been inconceivable
that he could have lost to-day, especially to a
mere child like this, who gambled so imprudently
and thoughtlessly that he must lose everything
he had won. And Willberg went on losing; the
heap of money shrunk more and more. Several
times some of his comrades were on the point of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
saying, "Stop; save at least a couple of thousand
marks." But that wouldn't do; it wouldn't be
fair. As earlier they had allowed the Uhlan,
who was their guest, to get to the point of losing
everything, they could not now warn Willberg.</p>

<p>"Now, Herr Willberg, have you the courage
to go on?"</p>

<p>He sat there, white as a corpse; every drop of
blood had vanished from his face. He had lost
all; his ¬£50 note of which he had been so proud;
not the smallest gold coin did he possess.</p>

<p>"Will you go on playing?" the Uhlan asked
for the second time.</p>

<p>Willberg looked round. Perhaps one of his
companions would lend him some money. But
the adjutant stepped in: "No, that's enough
for you to-day. Some of us others will now
try our luck."</p>

<p>They went on playing, but Willberg went into
an ante-room and sank down on a sofa. Suddenly
he was overcome by a nervous reaction; he buried
his face in his hands and burst into convulsive
sobs.</p>

<p>George was standing not far from him, and
looked at him sorrowfully and sympathetically.
He could not in the least understand&mdash;he had
not the faintest comprehension of how a man could
become so infatuated with a game of cards; but
in spite of this he was sorry for the poor fellow
whose pecuniary difficulties were no secret. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
one brief moment he had been rich; now he was
poorer than ever, because he had experienced the
feeling of possessing money, if only for the time
being. It was on the tip of his tongue to go up
to his comrade and offer him help; but he had
not the courage to put himself forward in this
way; he did not wish to risk a snub. And he
was quite sure he had acted wisely when Willberg,
having recovered his self-possession, got up to
go home and went out as if he had not been aware
of George's presence. Was he ashamed of his
reckless gambling or his tears? He went off
without bidding George adieu.</p>

<p>The latter was therefore greatly astonished
when next morning Willberg visited him in his
rooms. From the first moment he guessed the
object of this visit, and his guess became a
certainty when he saw his visitor's pale face.
After a few casual words of greeting the latter
came to the point.</p>

<p>"Last night you were with us, though only as
a spectator, so you know that I lost all my winnings,
but I also lost another thousand which I
had just received, in order to pay some pressing
accounts. I have tried to borrow the money
from one of my friends, but the Uhlan has cleaned
them all out in the same way, so that not one of
them to-day has as much as a thousand that he
can call his own. Even our chief is going about
with empty pockets. So I have come to you to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
ask if you can lend me this. I must tell you,
quite openly and straightforwardly, that I cannot
name the exact day when I can return you the
money, but I will do so as soon as ever I can, I
give you my word."</p>

<p>"But, please, I really do not require that."</p>

<p>George had risen, and went to his desk to get a
note, which he handed to his companion.</p>

<p>The latter shook George's hand gratefully.
"You have done me a great service." And after
a slight pause, he continued, with unmistakable
embarrassment, "I have just one more request:
I may rely on your not telling anyone that I have
borrowed from you?"</p>

<p>"How could I do such a thing?" asked
George, astonished.</p>

<p>But the other did not appear perfectly satisfied
with this answer. "Don't take it amiss, but I
beg you to give me your word that you will not
tell anyone of my visit to you?"</p>

<p>George looked at him with intense astonishment.
How could Willberg ask such a thing?
However he said: "If it is any satisfaction to
you, I will certainly give you my word, though
I cannot see any reason for it."</p>

<p>Willberg breathed more freely and took leave,
after thanking George most warmly.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER V<br />
  <span class="smcap">Hildegarde and George</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Several</span> weeks passed and George was still
"sent to Coventry by the regiment," as he called
it. He still had not a single friend with whom
he had any close relations. His hope that Willberg,
whom he had helped out of his difficulty,
would get on more friendly terms with him,
was not fulfilled. On the contrary, the latter
had less to do with him than usual, although he
had not yet paid his debt. George did not
trouble about this. He had already had many
disagreeable experiences in these matters in his
old regiment; but as he himself had grown up
in quite different circumstances, he did not really
grasp the attitude of the "Golden Butterflies"
with regard to money. They had no hesitation,
even in the presence of the orderlies, in borrowing
from each other. Very often, indeed, they made
no scruples about saying to their servants:
"Spend this or that amount on my behalf," but
the money was not always returned to the orderly
the same day. They got credit wherever they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
could, and borrowed from all possible sources.
In the chief restaurant, where they often passed
the evenings rather than stay at home in barracks,
many of the officers owed the waiter fifty
or sixty marks actually in cash, besides what they
owed for food and drinks. And it was just those
who owed the waiter most, who lived most
extravagantly, ate the dearest food and drank
the most expensive wine, and when they went
off it was always, "Muller, put down twenty
marks to my account, you know you'll get it
all right." But the question was, when? Some
of the officers had owed this money for months,
and they never thought of paying back; so
long as they wore a uniform, surely the money
was safe enough. George noticed with astonishment
that the officers in Berlin were just as lax
in these matters as they had been in his former
regiment. Once in the little garrison town, in
a restaurant much frequented by the military,
there was a row with the landlord; the officers
boycotted the place and swore that the fellow
shouldn't get another penny from them. But
not a single one of them thought of paying his
debts, part of which were due to the landlord,
part to the waiter. It was only when the landlord
complained to the colonel that he obtained
redress, but even then it was in a curious manner.
The colonel did not order his officers to pay their
debts within twenty-four hours, but he gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
them six weeks in which to discharge their
liabilities. And so the landlord and the waiter,
who really needed their money, had to wait
patiently all that time.</p>

<p>George remembered another incident that
had taken place only a few weeks ago. One
morning a senior lieutenant had appeared at
lunch much excited, and said that the hairdresser
to whom they all went had written and dunned
him on account of a miserable debt of a few
pounds, and had threatened him with a summons
through the post, as he was in great difficulties
and wanted his money at once. The officer
openly admitted that he had had the hairdresser's
bill several times, but had never paid him a
penny. But, in spite of this, there was a storm
of indignation at the hairdresser's daring to
write to him. Why should the fellow want his
money in such a hurry? Couldn't he wait?
The few pounds were quite safe, and nobody
ever sends a man of position a summons through
the post. The end of the story was that the
"Golden Butterflies" were forbidden to patronise
the hairdresser's shop, but, in spite of this, the
officers who owed money there did not discharge
their debt.</p>

<p>Certainly in all matters connected with money
they had few scruples and lax views. Debts
were only considered as such when they consisted
of actual money; they never reckoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
in what was owing to a tradesman. The fellow
was there, of course, to give credit; he had to
wait two or three years, sometimes much longer,
before getting his money. He ought to be delighted
if the officers came into his shop, and
ought to be willing to pay something for the
honour of having such customers, and getting
a good advertisement. They got credit everywhere,
and once it happened that a lieutenant
owed his own servant twenty marks. The
incident was revealed when the recruits were
dismissed. The colonel when discharging the
recruits said: "Has any one of you any claims
on the regiment? if so, let him make it now."
Then a young recruit stepped forward and said
in a loud voice: "I am still owed twenty marks
by my former lieutenant, which he borrowed
from me a few months ago when I had some
money from home." The matter was investigated,
and found to be quite correct; the fellow
was paid his money and the lieutenant received
a severe rebuke. But everyone thought it was
an unheard-of thing for a discharged soldier to
bring a complaint against his former lieutenant.
Nobody, however, asked if the man were in a
position to bear the loss of twenty marks.</p>

<p>George remained completely isolated among
his companions. Nobody troubled in the least
about him. His astonishment therefore was all
the greater when one day after lunch his adjutant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
sat down beside him, and engaged him in a long
and very friendly conversation. He could not
quite account for this mark of distinction, but
he quickly understood when Count Wettborn
suddenly said to him: "I have for a long time
meant to ask you why your father does not try
to get a title. The thing is certainly not easy,
but your father is well thought of by His Majesty,
and it would be easy to overcome the difficulty
if your father would be disposed to give a couple
of hundred thousand marks for some charitable
object. Your father could certainly do that&mdash;why
doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"Because my father is proud of his own name,
which he has made an honourable one."</p>

<p>The count rubbed his feet with some embarrassment,
then he said: "Of course, your father
is quite right as far as he himself is concerned,
but he ought to think of you. You would take
quite a different position in Society if you were
a baron or a count. The world lays great stress
on this, and in my opinion it is quite right. For
you, especially, now that you belong to a distinguished
regiment, a title would be of the
greatest value."</p>

<p>The count talked to George for a long time,
and the latter saw clearly that the adjutant in
saying all he did was not following a sudden
impulse, but was acting on mature reflection,
and had evidently consulted the wish of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
colonel or one or other of the military authorities.
George felt the blood mount to his cheeks. He
felt ashamed that his companion had the audacity
to talk to him in this way. Good heavens!
was a title then, which could be bought for a few
hundred thousands, really of much more importance
to these aristocratic lieutenants, who were
ciphers when they got out of their uniforms,
than a good, old, simple middle-class name
which was honoured and respected by the whole
commercial world?</p>

<p>He could not help saying in reply to the
adjutant: "My father has often enough been
offered a peerage, but every time he has refused
it."</p>

<p>"I cannot understand such a thing." The
count stuck his eyeglass in more firmly and looked
at George with speechless astonishment. "I
really cannot understand it," he repeated, and
George saw that he spoke in bitter earnest. He
really <i>could</i> not understand how a man could
refuse a title, simply because he was proud of his
own plain name.</p>

<p>For a long while the adjutant sat silent, then
he finished the conversation with the remark:
"Well, perhaps you will write to your father
again about this matter, or, better still, perhaps
you will talk to him. You may be able to change
his mind."</p>

<p>George did not answer, but he knew how his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
father always laughed at the people who directly
they had made money had no other ambition
in life but to get a title. He felt that the words
which the adjutant had just addressed to him
were almost an insult, and yet when he considered
them quietly, he could not altogether take umbrage
at them. He saw every day of his life
how the aristocracy had the preference in everything;
how even in these enlightened days a
title possessed many advantages, and that it was
given to men of wealth as a distinction and an
honour. And even in the army was not a title
of advantage to a man? If three officers, one
of whom had a title, went in for a post, was not
the aristocrat always chosen, and if by the rarest
chance a middle-class man was ever successful
in such a case, was he not at once ennobled?
The position of an officer is only suited for a
man with a title. The old adage was very suitable
for present days&mdash;the plebeian in the army
who did not distinguish himself in some extremely
remarkable manner would never get promotion
as soon as the most ordinary commonplace titled
officer.</p>

<p>And was it any different in Society? George
had now been to quite enough social entertainments
to know how everyone bowed down to a
title; how even the youngest aristocratic lieutenant
was considered superior to a staff-officer
of plebeian birth. And how often had he not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
noticed how people hummed and hawed at the
sight of him, and could not understand how it
was he belonged to such a distinguished regiment.
Although the words had been softly spoken he
had once heard a young girl at a ball whisper
to a friend: "If Lieutenant Winkler asks me to
dance, I shall say my programme is full; I shall
certainly not dance with a middle-class officer."</p>

<p>All the women regarded him as an outsider.
A bare nod was their only greeting, even the
one or two who shook hands with him did this
without breaking off their conversation, and
with an expression which showed they thought
they were doing him a great favour. But he was
just as much isolated in the army as in Society;
his comrades chattered and laughed with the
ladies, had all kinds of little intrigues with them,
made engagements with them, while he wandered
about alone and bored. He was an "outsider,"
and nobody troubled to introduce him.</p>

<p>The only person who was always pleasant
to him was Hildegarde. They had often come
across one another, and a sincere friendship had
sprung up between them. The two "outcasts"
Hildegarde called himself and her to her relatives.
George was never introduced, and she herself
occupied a curious position in Society. She
was no longer quite a young girl, and interest
in her charms had vanished. People invited
her out, it is true, but that was largely because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
they could not do anything else, but privately
they always hoped she would not accept the
invitation. When she did go to parties, contemptuous
remarks were made behind her back.
Hildegarde acted as if she were quite unconscious
of them, but she understood the glances that were
directed towards her, and even when she did not
actually hear the words, she knew very well how
the people shook their heads over her and whispered
to each other. It was a great effort of self-control
to go to these entertainments, and after
every party she said to herself: "To-day is the
very last time I will go; to-morrow I shall go
home."</p>

<p>But the terrible anxiety which always reigned
in her home kept her at her aunt's. "I would
rather endure these secret remarks than see
the poverty and misery at home, and bear their
reproaches." At intervals she confessed to herself
that she stayed on George's account; not
that she could say she was exactly in love with
him. The question of marriage had been so
much and so often talked about, that love seemed
a ridiculous thing, and it all depended on whether
the man had money or not. The holiest of feelings
had been so unreservedly discussed in her
presence that she believed that her heart was
no longer accessible to love. In George she
saw a reliable friend. He was always very attentive
to her; as soon as he saw her by herself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
he came to her side, and she felt his glance continually
on her. His glance seemed to say:
"I do not know, of course, what anxiety is
troubling you, but I know that you are feeling
sad and lonely here, just as I am, and I want,
therefore, to do what I can for you."</p>

<p>This evening she was to meet him again. There
was a great reception at the American ambassador's,
and she was delighted at the prospect
of seeing him. She had dressed herself specially
well for his benefit, and had put on a new costume
which her aunt had just given her. In pleasant
anticipation of the entertainment she had begun
to dress sooner than usual, and now a quarter
of an hour before it was time to go she was standing
in front of the looking-glass and regarding
herself smilingly. She was pleased with her
own beauty, and knew that to-day, at any rate,
she would once again arouse admiration.</p>

<p>She was standing deep in thought when a knock
at the door aroused her. "Is it time yet? I
am quite ready. I'll come at once."</p>

<p>"Madam has plenty of time. The carriage
is not yet at the door, but there is an express
message for you."</p>

<p>Hildegarde was alarmed. An express letter
for her! Whatever could have happened?</p>

<p>She opened the door and took the letter from
the girl, and she shuddered involuntarily when
she recognised her brother's handwriting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" She threw the letter on the
table with annoyance. Without opening she
knew perfectly well that it contained a request
for money. A feeling of repugnance came over
her. "Why should he spoil my pleasure just
at this moment? How can I possibly ask my
aunt for anything when she has just given me
this costly dress?" All her pleasure had vanished.
"Well," she said to herself at last, "the letter
shall not spoil my temper to-day. I shall read
it to-morrow, or this evening, when I get back
again."</p>

<p>An inward feeling of anxiety, however, caused
her to tear open the envelope, and she read:</p>

<div class="blockq">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear little Hildegarde</span>,&mdash;You know the
old story how the watchman summoned a woman
out of bed and called out to her: 'Mrs. Meyer,
you are going to have a terrible shock; your
husband is dead.' Well, I say to you now, dear
Hildegarde, don't be frightened, but I must have
four thousand marks. The deuce take it, but
I haven't had a bit of luck lately. Yesterday
morning I had a whole heap of dunning letters.
I didn't know myself where all the people came
from who suddenly demanded money. Where on
earth am I to get it from without stealing it?
So I tried my luck at cards, but the luck was
against me, and when I woke up this morning
with a splitting headache I found I had lost four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
thousand marks. Thank heaven I have three
days' respite, but then I must settle the affair,
or nothing else remains but to put the necessary
bullet through my head. You know that other
debts don't worry me, but gambling debts are
debts of honour, and there must be no fleck on
our honour. Rather than this, we must make
our exit from this world. Better die than be
dishonoured. So, dear Hilda, I must have four
brown bits of paper, and you must manage to
get them for me. I ask you this with much less
reluctance than usual, because I hear with the
greatest joy that you are just about to be engaged.
Well, it's high time, Hilda, both for you and for
us. Don't disappoint us again. You have gone
off considerably during the last year or so. When
I saw you last I had quite a shock. Don't
misunderstand me. You are still, of course, a
very pretty girl, but nothing compared with
what you were. Well, the main thing now is
for you to capture this Winkler or whatever
he's called. What sort of a man is he? Aunt
writes to mother that he pays you the very
greatest attention. You can imagine how beside
themselves with joy they are at home.
Father wrote to me that in honour of the welcome
news he had immediately completed his wine
cellar, and like a chivalrous gentleman he drank
your health in French champagne. He can't
stand that German stuff any longer. Father<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
suffers frightfully from indigestion, you know.
Aunt tells us also that your future father-in-law
manufactures buttons. It's a frightful idea,
but is it really true? However, the main thing
is that he manufactures enough of them! Keep
him tight! You have fine eyes, use them well
and you'll secure him. And when you are
once engaged, which it is to be hoped will be
within the next few days, then hurry on the
marriage, so that he may not have time for
regrets, and before he learns how we are reckoning
on his money. When he's once my brother-in-law
I'll manage to extract the ducats from
him. I don't feel in the least anxious about
<i>that</i>!</p>

<p>"Well, Hilda, I've written enough for to-day.
I have to go on duty, the colonel has just summoned
a meeting of officers to read out to us
again the most stringent regulations concerning
Courts of Honour. Isn't it ridiculous nonsense!
As if one didn't know how to behave as an honourable
gentleman indeed! If a man doesn't <i>feel</i>
these things he doesn't learn them by yawning
more or less loudly while these endless regulations
are read out to him.</p>

<p>"Send me, please, the four thousand marks;
uncle will give it you at once if you tell him it
will be paid back directly after your marriage.
Let me impress this upon you: have your
marriage contract drawn up at a lawyer's, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
mind you have a good income settled upon you.
In your place, I wouldn't accept less than forty
thousand marks a year. The fellow must expect
to pay something for marrying into such a
distinguished family. However, I must tell you
that, in spite of the French champagne which
father was only able to get on credit on the
strength of your approaching marriage, things
at home are in a frightful condition. Father
wrote and asked me to send him a few thousand,
or at least a few hundred marks if I won at cards.
Ah, if the old gentleman had an idea of the
terrible hole I am in! Now, dear Hilda, arrange
your affairs satisfactorily. With love and kisses.&mdash;Your
affectionate brother,</p>

<p class="toright">"<span class="smcap">Fritz.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p>Every drop of blood vanished from Hildegarde's
face as she read the letter. She stood
motionless, and a feeling of repugnance came
over her, as it often did when she had news from
home. She tore the letter into a thousand
pieces and stamped them under foot.</p>

<p>Then she sank into a chair and buried her face
in her hands. "They ought to be ashamed
of writing to me in this way," she moaned.
"Just imagine their regarding me as a chattel
that is to be sold to the highest bidder. What
is it that Fritz writes?&mdash;'He must expect
to pay something if he marries into our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
distinguished family.' Distinguished family!"
and she laughed bitterly. "Bankrupts, gamblers,
men with whom nobody would have anything
to do if it were not that they owned noble names
and wore uniforms. A man has only to wear an
officer's uniform and belong to an aristocratic
family, and, of course, he is a man of honour."</p>

<p>She roused herself from her meditations when
her aunt came in to inquire whether she was
dressed, and when she saw Hildegarde's face
she clasped her hands in horror.</p>

<p>"But, Hildegarde, whatever is the matter?
What has happened?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde shrugged her shoulders contemptuously.
"What has happened! You
can see by these pieces on the floor. Fritz has
been gambling again, he needs four thousand
marks. I am to ask you for it." Then suddenly
she burst forth with passionate indignation:
"Aunt, how could you tell them at home that
my engagement with Lieutenant Winkler was
about to take place? You ought not to have
done such a thing; the consequences have been
serious. On the strength of their prospective
son-in-law and brother-in-law, both my father
and Fritz have contracted all kinds of debts.
And I do not really know if Lieutenant Winkler
even loves me. I scarcely think so, but if he
should get to love me and want to marry me,
then I know what I shall do: I shall open his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
eyes to everything. When he asks for my hand
I shall tell him how I have been sent for years
to Berlin in order to get a rich husband; how
my relatives reckon on his money, and what
they think of his plebeian birth. I shall tell
him everything, for even if I do not love Lieutenant
Winkler, I honour him and respect him
too highly to deceive him. He shall know and
understand clearly into what an honourable
family he is about to marry. I shall tell him
everything!"</p>

<p>"You will do no such thing." Frau von
Warnow had listened to Hildegarde, speechless
with amazement, and it was quite a long time
before she regained her composure. "You will
do no such thing," she repeated with anger.
"You have not only your duty to your own
people, but to us also. I will not remind you
of what we have already done for you. It is true
we are rich, but, in spite of this, naturally we
should not have given you, your parents and
your brother, hundreds and hundreds of pounds
if we had not taken it for granted that you would
have repaid us in some way or other. When you
say that you will tell Lieutenant Winkler everything
before marriage, you say something that
is simply ridiculous. The four thousand marks
won't matter in the least to him with all his
money, and you may be sure he's clever enough
to know that a beautiful girl only marries a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
middle-class lieutenant for his money. If you
tell him everything beforehand you warn him,
to a certain extent, against marrying you, and
then he can't very well help drawing back.
And then, what will you do?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde shrugged her beautiful shoulders.
"What shall I do? I don't mind in the least.
I shouldn't starve. As I told you before, I should
get a situation of some kind or other."</p>

<p>Her aunt laughed contemptuously: "You
are out of your mind! What do you know, I
say? What can you do? Have you any idea of
housekeeping, cooking, domestic work? You
certainly couldn't get a post as a companion.
You are not a good musician, you don't read
aloud well, your knowledge of foreign languages
is practically <i>nil</i>. So how could you earn your
living?" She spoke with the bitterest irony,
but when she saw the look of despair on Hildegarde's
face, sympathy got the better of her,
and almost tenderly she put her arm round the
girl's neck. "Don't be so sad, it will turn out
better than you think. I can quite understand
that Fritz's letter has terribly upset you, but
he doesn't mean it all. I will talk to your uncle
to-day about sending the money. He shall send
it, or I will. And now, hold your head high.
It is high time for us to go."</p>

<p>"Yes, do go, aunt, but let me stay at home.
I am really not in the mood to go to a party."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"What? Hildegarde,"&mdash;her aunt thought she
could not have heard rightly&mdash;"you want to
stay at home? That would never do. Especially
to-day when the court has promised to put in
an appearance, you must not fail to be there.
And do you imagine that I had this costly new
costume made for you to take it off and put it in
your wardrobe? Whatever answer should I give
when people inquired after you?"</p>

<p>A sorrowful little laugh played round Hildegarde's
mouth.</p>

<p>"Nobody will ask after me; they will be
delighted not to see me."</p>

<p>"And what about Lieutenant Winkler? What
am I to say to him when he makes inquiries
after you?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde looked at her aunt with wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you not really understand that it is
precisely on his account that I don't want to go
to the reception? It would be simply impossible
for me to talk to him naturally and pleasantly
after Fritz's letter and our conversation." Suddenly,
however, she changed her mind: "No,
you are quite right. I will not allow the day,
to which I have so greatly looked forward, to
be spoiled."</p>

<p>Her aunt embraced her tenderly:</p>

<p>"That is quite right, my child. Come along
now, the carriage is at the door."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>They drove immediately to the embassy. They
were somewhat late, rows and rows of carriages
were drawn up before the gates, and it was long
before their carriage could drive in. Herr and
Frau von Warnow conversed about the occupants
of the other carriages, which were close by them,
exchanged remarks concerning the elegance of
their various acquaintances, and passed the time
in wondering which of the royalties would put
in an appearance to-day. Hildegarde sat silent
in her corner. In answer to her uncle she had
pleaded a headache, and Frau von Warnow had
given her husband a sign not to pursue the
matter. So she could remain undisturbed in her
thoughts. What had really made her change
her mind and go to the reception? A sudden
desire had sprung up in her to meet George, to
see and converse with an honourable man. She
did not exactly know how she was to do it, but
she had made up her mind to stick to her resolution
and to say to him: "Pay your court to some
one who is worthier of you than I am." Before
she would accept any more attentions from him
she wanted to tell him about her father and brother.
If then he continued to treat her with peculiar
chivalry, and to endeavour to win her hand, her
conscience would be quite free, and she could look
him in the face honestly and straightforwardly.</p>

<p>"Aren't you ever going to get out, Hildegarde?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Hildegarde got out. She had sat in her
corner with closed eyes, and did not notice
that the footman had been holding open the
door for a long time. She followed the others,
and a quarter of an hour later she walked into
the enormous reception-rooms in which a brilliant
company was assembled. There were endless
greetings and hand-shakings, endless inquiries
after health and the events of the last few days.
Everybody was constantly looking with expectation
towards the door, for the court party was
momentarily expected. Although no one, of
course, would have confessed it, all were consumed
with anxiety to see whether His Majesty
would notice and talk to them, and distinguish
them by shaking hands. Each one hoped that
he would enjoy this distinction. Nobody
wanted the other to have it, and each hoped,
in secret, that he alone would be noticed by the
Emperor.</p>

<p>George was standing by Hildegarde's side.
She noticed how he had sought her out, though
she had hoped to avoid him, but her tall figure
prevented him from losing sight of her. She
feigned, however, to be astonished when he
suddenly said: "How do you do?" to her,
but she read in his eyes that he had seen through
her little ruse, and without further preamble
he said to her: "Are you vexed with me for
any reason, baroness?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked at him frankly and honestly.
"No, certainly not."</p>

<p>His face lit up. "That's all right, then."
After a slight pause he said: "You avoided me.
Is it at all disagreeable to you for me to be by
your side?"</p>

<p>Again she cast a frank look at him. "Not
at all," and then somewhat hesitatingly she
added: "Will you be so kind as to take me
in to supper this evening?" She really meant
to say: "I want to talk to you," but she could
not get out the words.</p>

<p>He bowed gratefully. "If we should lose
sight of each other in this crowd, baroness, let
us meet again at this place, if it is agreeable
to you."</p>

<p>She nodded agreement, and stepped back a
little, for at this moment the royal party was
announced. A mysterious stillness reigned, the
stir of voices was hushed; everyone looked at
His Majesty, who had come into the room, and
smiling graciously, walked down the long row
of bowed figures. Here and there he stopped
and exchanged a friendly word or handshake,
and everybody who enjoyed this distinction was
almost annihilated by his neighbours' envious
glances.</p>

<p>Suddenly His Majesty stopped in front of
George and graciously extended his hand. "Ah,
you are here, dear Winkler. How are you?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
To-day I received a very interesting report from
your father. I must have a talk with him as
soon as possible, and then you must come with
your father and dine with me."</p>

<p>George bent his head to kiss his sovereign's
hand, and as he did so, the Emperor noticed
Hildegarde, and greeted her with a friendly
smile. "Are you still turning the heads of all
my lieutenants, baroness?" he asked playfully;
"though that is easy enough when one is as
beautiful as you are." And with a laughing
glance he passed on.</p>

<p>In the stillness that reigned, His Majesty's
words had been heard by the whole room, and
now all eyes were turned on Hildegarde and
George, who were naturally delighted at the
honour that had fallen to them, although they
were a little embarrassed at the harmless badinage.
They stood there silently, and were glad when
the people began to talk and walk about again.
They did not see each other again till midnight,
when supper was announced. As usual, it was
set out on small tables, and George was fortunate
in finding one at which the guests were unknown
to him, and so he could talk undisturbed to
Hildegarde. However, they were temporarily
the objects of their companions' notice, and
some of the ladies spoke freely about the remarks
which the Emperor had made about Hildegarde.
Indeed one, a haggard, tall woman, examined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Hildegarde most impertinently through her
lorgnette, and then said half aloud: "Well, I
can't understand why His Majesty should think
her so good-looking."</p>

<p>Hildegarde threw a perfectly frank glance at
the speaker and laughed aloud, then she turned
to George and said: "I cannot tell you how
delighted I am at the words the Emperor addressed
to you. I am firmly convinced you will
now at once take your right position both in
Society and in the regiment, which before you
were unable to do."</p>

<p>George shrugged his shoulders. "I scarcely
think so, baroness. I fear these gracious words
will have done me more harm than good. People
will grudge both me and my father praise from
so exalted a quarter. However, I am not going
to let that spoil my pleasure in the public recognition
of my father. Do me the honour of
drinking to his health."</p>

<p>"With the greatest of pleasure," and the
glasses clicked.</p>

<p>"I want you to know my father, baroness,"
George went on: "you would like him, though
naturally most of the people here would not.
They would never pardon him for not wearing
well-starched cuffs, and for not tying his cravat
in the proper manner. I think, however, you
would like him. Perhaps the next time he
comes to Berlin I might introduce him to you?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
He is bringing my sister with him, and, as I
have so often told her about you in my letters,
she is most anxious to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>Hildegarde was somewhat embarrassed at
these words. Then he had also told his people
about her, perhaps even he had confessed that
he meant to win her hand. The remembrance
of her brother's letter came back to her. She
must tell him all before it was too late. How
was she to do it? Nobody was paying any
attention to their conversation, but how was
she to express what she wanted to say? As he
had not told her what his intentions were, she
could not very well say to him: "Don't think
of wooing; on account of my family I will
not and cannot be your wife." And yet if
without further explanations she spoke about
their poverty at home, might it not occur to
him that perhaps she expected help from him
or his father. She could find no way out of
the difficulty. Then she wondered why he had
never spoken to her about his sister. She was
much astonished, and at last she said: "Have
you a sister, then, Lieutenant Winkler? Why
did you never tell me about her?"</p>

<p>He looked at her surprised: "What! did I
never tell you about her? You mustn't take
that amiss, for I had no intention of not talking
about her to you."</p>

<p>"And why should you not talk about her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
to other people?" she inquired, with some
curiosity.</p>

<p>George was embarrassed, and blushed like a
child. "I can't exactly explain it. Perhaps it
is that when one loves anybody very much one
does not speak much about them to anyone.
And even if I had wanted to talk about her, to
whom should I have talked? In the regiment
no one takes the faintest interest in me, far
less in my family, and naturally, I don't talk
about such matters unless I am asked." Then,
after a slight pause, he continued: "And there's
another reason why I don't care to talk about
Elsa."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" Hildegarde asked, as
he was silent.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to express in words exactly
what I want to say. I don't want to appear
suspicious of my comrades, neither do I wish
to represent myself as a model of virtue, which,
indeed, I am not, and could not be, at twenty-seven
years old. But I can't help saying that
at mess my fellow-officers have a way of talking
about young girls, whom they meet in Society,
which is simply revolting to me. No, not
revolting, that's too strong," he corrected himself.
"I am simply astounded, and constantly
say to myself: 'Haven't these officers sisters,
and haven't their mothers taught them any
respect and reverence for women; so that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
don't treat all alike?' In my old regiment it
was quite different; we were not perhaps more
moral men, but in the little town where we
were brought into such close relationship with
the few families, we could not criticise the young
girls so freely and so shamelessly. I remember
how once at dinner an officer went so far as
to make an insulting remark about one of the
ladies. The orderlies were sent out of the room,
and the oldest officer at the table, an old captain,
read the young lieutenant such a lecture before
us all, that he never said a single word in excuse."</p>

<p>"That is as it ought to be," said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"Certainly," George agreed, "that is why I
am astonished that our officers don't feel like
that. If only the girls, who so often regard a
lieutenant as the paragon of perfection, knew,
or could hear with their own ears how the officers
talk about them after they have been to an
entertainment, they would blush with shame,
and a lieutenant would soon cease to be their
ideal. There are, of course, exceptions, thank
God! but most of my fellow-officers are as I
have just described, and it is the same in other
regiments; to them a woman is just like a
horse&mdash;a thing to be examined and appraised.
How is it, I wonder, that a young girl is of so
little account to a lieutenant, that he talks of
her without the least respect? I have often
thought over the matter. Is it, perhaps due<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
to their education? Most of them grow up
in the regiment; they have no home life; they
only see their sisters and their friends when
on leave; as cadets, they go into Society to
make conquests, and each conquest helps to
lower all young girls in their eyes. Perhaps the
girls themselves are to a certain extent answerable
for this state of affairs. In Society there
exists no one but a lieutenant for them, they
ignore a civilian, unless he happens to be a
reserve officer. The lieutenant simply goes about
in pursuit of conquest, and often he wins the
victory only too easily. I cannot speak of
this from my own experience. I am a stranger
here, but I have often heard my comrades talk
of young girls who push themselves forward,
send them love-letters, and who do not even
wait until they are asked to give a rendezvous,
but ask permission to be allowed to visit the
officers, either in a friend's house, or in the
officers' quarters."</p>

<p>"But, Lieutenant Winkler," interrupted Hildegarde,
"no lady would do such a thing."</p>

<p>"She certainly ought not to do so," he agreed,
"but, nevertheless, she does. Just give a glance
at the select company here. How many of these
aristocratic ladies have not a more or less harmless
intrigue with a lieutenant? It is not only
the married ladies, I can assure you. Those young
girls trip about so modestly and chastely, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
their great pride is that, in spite of their youth,
they have had a <i>past</i>."</p>

<p>Hildegarde knew only too well that he was
right. She remembered how most of the friends
of her youth had had a lieutenant lover. How
often had she not spoken to them about this,
and reproached them, but all had given the
same answer: "Why shouldn't I have a lover?
the others have, and what's the use of being
young and beautiful? Do you think that our
blood remains calm when a man pays court to
us the whole evening, presses us closely to him
when dancing, and casts longing glances at us?
Are we to wait till we have a husband? We
may wait a long time, perhaps for ever, and
what then? Do you want us to die without
having had experience of life? How ridiculous!"</p>

<p>They told one another with truly cynical
frankness how they managed to deceive their
parents and prevent any consequence of their
intrigues. Perhaps Hildegarde was naturally too
cold and too lacking in passion to understand
her friends. Above all, she could not understand
the officers who, more than all others,
ought to be regarded as honourable men, and
who yet made no scruples of entering into a
<i>liaison</i> with the wife or daughter of the house
where they enjoyed the pleasantest social relations.</p>

<p>Hildegarde and George sat for a long time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
occupied with their own thoughts. George misinterpreted
Hildegarde's silence. He thought
she was perhaps vexed with his remarks, and
so he said:</p>

<p>"I hope you are not angry with me for having
spoken so freely and frankly in your presence;
but we have both of us been brought up among
quite different circumstances and educated in
quite different views."</p>

<p>Hildegarde felt that she blushed. Grown up
among different circumstances indeed! It was
entirely her own merit that she did not resemble
her companions. Perhaps, however, it was
partly due to her father and brother who had
constantly written to her: "Don't throw yourself
away, and don't enter into a <i>liaison</i> if you
are not sure that it will lead to marriage. You
will get nothing out of it, and then you lower
your value and utterly destroy the hopes we
set upon you."</p>

<p>How often had she not wondered whether
her brother would have been quite inconsolable
if she had written to him: "I have not found
a husband but a friend. If you will pardon
this, I will pay your debts."</p>

<p>She did not doubt that he would accept the
money in order to remain an officer and play
the f√™ted and envied r√¥le in Society of a soldier.</p>

<p>"Are you angry with me?" George asked,
as Hildegarde still remained silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>She roused herself from her thoughts. "Why
should I be?" And in order to turn the conversation,
which was painful to her, to another
subject, she again inquired about his sister.
And then George told her all about his sister&mdash;how
charming and beautiful she was, how kindly
and good, how they had grown up together as
excellent friends, and how often they had fought
each other's battles when they were children.
He told his stories gaily, with sparkling eyes,
and Hildegarde listened with interest.</p>

<p>"Do you know, I envy you your sister, or
rather the pleasant relation in which you stand
to her. Sisterly love is such a beautiful thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly; but you are also in that
happy situation. You have a brother."</p>

<p>"Please do not speak to me about him."</p>

<p>There was such a tone of contempt and depreciation
in her words that he looked at her
with astonishment.</p>

<p>"But, baroness, he is your brother."</p>

<p>"You do not know him. Please let us change
the subject."</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you wish it."</p>

<p>In his embarrassment George emptied his
glass and vainly thought of another topic, and
both were glad when at last everybody rose
from the table.</p>

<p>The ball went on till the small hours of the
morning, and during the dancing George never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
lost sight of Hildegarde. He had the pleasure
of being able to introduce some fresh officers
and partners; and he was really more delighted
than she was at the admiration she evoked.</p>

<p>It was late when at last the ball broke up.
George, at the last moment, was unable to say
farewell to Hildegarde, and he walked home
with a companion in a somewhat bad humour.</p>

<p>His companion was apparently occupied with
some thoughts that interested him. Suddenly
he stood still and seized George by the arm.
"What will you bet that he wins her? That
would be much better than a lucky stroke at
cards."</p>

<p>George regarded his comrade with astonishment.
"I don't understand what you mean.
Whom are you speaking about?"</p>

<p>The other went on walking again. "Oh,
yes, of course, you don't know Gastion of the
Hussars. My gracious, he has paid court to
Fr√§ulein von Reisinger this evening! Well, she
is no longer very young, and she never was
pretty, but her family is a very old Jewish one.
I believe her mother was a Moses, but that doesn't
matter. She has money; a frightful amount
of money. If Gastion gets that, he can live in
fine style. But he certainly needs it; he is
said to be two hundred thousand marks in
debt."</p>

<p>George had listened without apparently much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
interest. Then he said: "Is it not really
frightful that we officers&mdash;present company, of
course, excepted&mdash;when we choose a wife, make
it a matter of convenience? We live luxuriously,
we fling away our money and our health, and
when one day we are at the end of our tether,
we look out at balls and parties for a rich young
girl who will put things right for us again. The
more money she has the more, of course, we run
after her. How few marry on their pay!"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, that's ridiculous; who can
live on a few pence."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, though many people
manage to do so. But still is it not a very
interesting psychological fact that almost every
officer falls in love with a girl who is rich and
ugly? Yet no one of course ever admits that
he has married for money. It is indeed insulting
and libellous to suggest such a thing. On the
contrary, everyone pretends that in spite of his
wife's lack of beauty and more or less unpleasing
characteristics, he really loves her. If she had
no money he would of course not look at her.
To speak quite frankly, I cannot in the least
understand how rich parents can give their
daughter to an officer. People must know that
officers only accept their daughters because of
the money, and I cannot imagine how the girls
themselves can be so foolish as to suppose they
are married for love."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Excuse me," put in his companion, "you
are expressing very curious views. According
to you, then, young girls who are rich ought not
to marry at all."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, I do not say that, but
they ought to marry whom they like, only not
lieutenants, who, in nine hundred and ninety-nine
cases out of one thousand would not dream
of marrying if they were not up to their ears in
debt."</p>

<p>"It is all very well for you to talk," said the
other. "It is easy you know for a man who is
born into the world a millionaire to judge a poor
devil severely. What you say is all very beautiful
and noble in theory, but what about practice?
When I can, I prefer to ride in my own carriage,
rather than the electric tram. Ah, here our
ways separate, you go to the right, I to the left.
What time do you go on duty to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Not at all in the morning."</p>

<p>"Lucky fellow, I must be on parade at seven.
Good-night."</p>

<p>After a cool handshake the comrades separated
and a little later George reached his rooms.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
  <span class="smcap">Military Morals</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> had all turned out just as George had foretold;
the kindly words which His Majesty had addressed
to him at the American Embassy and the warm
praise of his father, had not contributed towards
improving his position in the regiment; on the
contrary, it had made it worse. Scarcely a
day passed but some one or other in George's
absence talked about him and discussed the
Emperor's remarks. Whatever had made the
Emperor specially distinguish him, the only
plebeian officer of the regiment? Even the
colonel had had to be content with a mere handshake,
the staff officers, not to mention the others,
had scarcely received a glance; George alone
had been addressed. Was it mere chance or
was it really the report of the button manufacturer&mdash;as
Old Winkler was always called for
shortness&mdash;that had occasioned the remarks?
And what on earth could such a manufacturer
tell His Majesty which he did not know already?
Old Winkler indeed was said to be unique in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
arrangements for the benefits of his workpeople
and in his efforts for their welfare, and he had
discovered new methods and means of ameliorating
their existence. Of course, everybody
knew that His Majesty was deeply interested in
the condition of the working classes, but in spite
of this, they thought this public praise of Old
Winkler somewhat ostentatious and superfluous,
if an officer&mdash;and therefore a loyal subject&mdash;might
venture to criticise His Majesty's words.
Or had the Emperor's words any particular
significance? The Emperor knew, of course,
what was thought about George in the regiment,
how he was still an "outsider," and would
always remain one. Had His Majesty's words
meant&mdash;"You need not trouble yourselves, you
will not get rid of Lieutenant Winkler, he has a
powerful protector in me." Had he perhaps
wanted to encourage George by his gracious
words to persevere and not to despair even if he
had not succeeded in winning a good position
in the regiment?</p>

<p>Not a single "Golden Butterfly" had ever
been commanded to attend at Court, except on
the occasion of some great entertainment; then
the regiment had appeared as a whole, and even
this distinction had made them feel very proud.
And now George was publicly invited by the
Emperor to come with his father to dine at Court.
It was well known that His Majesty frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
gave little parties where everybody was quite
unconstrained, and there was much lively conversation.
The Emperor surprised everyone by
the astonishing amount of his knowledge and
fascinated all by his great personal attractions.
Why should George be invited to share in these
intimate little parties? Simply because he was
the son of his father. And who indeed was his
father? He was merely a middle-class button
manufacturer, and he would remain that, even
if he were wiser and more important than all
the other wise men put together.</p>

<p>They would not have grudged any of their
other companions the honour which had been
paid to George. They would have regarded it
as an honour paid to the aristocratic classes to
which they themselves belonged. They grudged
it George because they said to themselves: "If
nowadays the middle-class is to be honoured in
this way, what is there then for the nobility,
who have done, and will do more, for Germany
than manufacture trouser-buttons, which certainly
have the advantage of being durable and
cheap."</p>

<p>Up till the present the officers had not troubled
to take any notice of George. Now they turned
their attention to him, and although he was
always quiet and modest in his behaviour to his
companions, and yet dignified without being
proud, they became even haughtier than they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
had formerly been. More than ever they were
the aristocrats; more than ever they endeavoured
to show him what a great and impassable barrier
divided him from them. Their behaviour indicated
as clearly as words: "We intend to get
rid of him; one day he himself will perceive
that he cannot possibly remain with us any
longer."</p>

<p>George was perfectly well aware of the feeling
that existed against him, and even if he had
wanted to deceive himself in this matter, one
thing would have opened his eyes to this fact.
This was the condescending manner in which
young Willberg regularly every week, purely as
a matter of form, made his excuses for not having
been able to return the ¬£50 which he had been
obliging enough to lend him.</p>

<p>"I really do not want the money," George said
every time; "on the contrary, I live so economically
that I save money. I would gladly
lend you a larger amount, and you need not
hurry about paying it back."</p>

<p>George noticed how very gladly young Willberg
accepted the generously-offered help, for it
was an open secret that he would not be able
to go on much longer. Nobody knew exactly
how he stood with regard to money matters.
He did not gamble more than the others, but
he had other expenses. In the eyes of young
girls in Society, he enjoyed much distinction in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
consequence of his <i>amours</i>. He knew how interesting
he was to them, because he had the reputation
of not being able to be faithful to anyone.
And he knew equally well that in spite of this
reputation, or rather just because of it, he would
have no difficulty in winning a rich wife one day.
The bride would be envied for having a <i>fianc√©</i>
with such an interesting past; they would
consider her lucky to have caught him. He
intended to marry later, but his wife must have
money, a great deal of money, for he had no
intention of changing his mode of life when he
was a married man. Willberg had no idea of
the value of money, and whenever he was able
to borrow a few pounds from a relative he could
not rest until he had spent it. He was continually
in debt, and just now things were very bad with
him. He was always complaining of his wretched
position, and drank more wine than usual to
drown his cares. He owed money all round the
regiment, and George foresaw that it would not
be long before young Willberg would again borrow
from him without being able to discharge his
former debt. And the moment came sooner
than even George had imagined.</p>

<p>George had gone home one day from the
mess-room earlier than usual. He had received
a letter from his friend Olga, a young actress at
the Residenz Theatre, saying that she would
come to supper with him. At first he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
thought of putting her off, as he had some
important work to do, but finally he had telegraphed
to her: "Come, I am expecting you."
He had not the heart to spoil her evening. She
was so fond of him, and so happy in his comfortable
and beautifully-furnished rooms. There
was nothing more delightful to her than to admire
his beautiful things and rummage in his library.</p>

<p>Soon they were sitting in the little dining-room,
opposite each other at the charmingly
decorated table, and George observed laughingly
how she enjoyed the oysters and Pommery.</p>

<p>"It is all very well for you to laugh. You
have just come from dinner, but I have eaten
nothing since three o'clock."</p>

<p>"My dear child, go on eating. I am only too
delighted if it is to your taste, and the more
you eat the better pleased I am. And when you
have finished these oysters here, there is another
dozen outside on ice, and after that there is
your favourite dish&mdash;stuffed artichokes."</p>

<p>She clapped her hands with pleasure like a
child; then she looked at him gratefully with
her wide-open, dark brown eyes, and softly
stroked his hand. "How good and kind you are
to me."</p>

<p>"Really, Olga!" He was almost embarrassed
by the feeling in her voice, and attempted
to joke: "Don't make fun of me, Olga. If
the whole extent of my kindness to you consists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
in my telling my landlady to cook your favourite
dishes, it is really not very much." And after a
slight pause, he added: "I am very fond of you,
little Olga."</p>

<p>She looked at him delighted. "Do you really
mean it?" And when he bowed and drank her
health, she said: "Do you know, I believe you.
Indeed when I am with you I know that you
are fond of me."</p>

<p>Suddenly she jumped up, clung to him, and
kissed him passionately.</p>

<p>"But, Olga, my dear girl, your oysters will be
getting cold," he said at last, as she went on
caressing him.</p>

<p>Laughingly she stopped and sat down again.</p>

<p>Olga was a picturesque looking girl of medium
height, faultless figure, a bright intelligent face,
wonderful brown eyes and a charming little nose.
Everything about her was <i>petite</i>. She had small
hands that were most carefully attended to, and
ravishing little feet. Her whole expression and
bearing was sympathetic in the highest degree.
Without being exactly clever she was amusing
and bright. One could talk to her for hours
together without suffering a moment's boredom;
she could tell amusing stories and was always
ready to see a joke. She laughed so heartily
that the tears came into her eyes, and when
she laughed she always showed her dazzling
white teeth. One thing about her was especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
attractive to George, she was a thoroughly
straightforward creature. She was always good-tempered
and amiable, never capricious or extravagant.
Only once had she ever expressed
a wish to George. For days he had noticed that
something worried her; he urged her constantly
to tell him, and at last she did so.</p>

<p>"But, first of all, you must put out the gas,
otherwise I shall be so terribly ashamed; you
mustn't look at me when I tell you."</p>

<p>Laughingly he had agreed to her wish, and
then she had confessed: "I want a little gold
watch tremendously."</p>

<p>And when he remained speechless with astonishment
at her modesty, she went on: "Don't
be angry with me, I saw a perfectly lovely watch
in a shop window for a hundred marks, but if
that is too much, a cheaper one will do perfectly
well."</p>

<p>When he had carried out her desire, and bought
her a costly watch and a gold chain, she had sat
the whole evening with him without taking any
interest in him, but playing with her watch,
alternately laughing and crying for joy. At
the beginning of their acquaintanceship she could
not be induced to accept anything from him;
for days he had argued with her, and only at
last did she allow him to make her an allowance
when he declared in the most emphatic manner
that otherwise he would have nothing further<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to do with her. He paid for her rooms and
everything she required without pampering her.
For his own sake he took care that things were
all right for her, and without her knowing it he
regularly put ¬£10 in the bank for her every
week. "Then at least she need not throw herself
into the arms of the first best man whenever
we separate," he said to himself.</p>

<p>He had been to the bank on her account this
very day, and on his way back he had bought
a pretty little brooch, which he just remembered.
"Good gracious, Olga, I quite forgot something.
Look, here's a little trifle for you."</p>

<p>He got up and fetched the jewel-case, and
enjoyed the delighted look that she cast upon
the ornament.</p>

<p>"George, you really ought not to give me
such presents."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, I never give more than
I can afford, and, like all my presents, it is paid
for."</p>

<p>She thanked him once more, then she said:
"Do you know, I am really to be envied for
knowing you? Don't misunderstand me, you
know perfectly well that I want nothing from
you and ask nothing of you. Once I know I
asked you for a watch, and I am heartily ashamed
of it, and if I had ever imagined that you would
have spent so much over it I would never have
mentioned it, for I would not have you imagine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
for a moment that I care for you because you
are rich."</p>

<p>"But, Olga, I know all that, you have no need
to tell me. You were going to tell me, however,
why you are to be envied because we are friends."</p>

<p>"Because you are an honourable man, because&mdash;well,
how can I tell you. You see all my
friends at the theatre have a patron and protector.
But what sort of men are they?
Men of the world in the worst sense of
the word, who bluster and bully, contract
debt after debt, and if they give a present
it is not paid for; everything they give is borrowed,
and that destroys all pleasure in receiving
the gift. But everything connected with you
is so high-class, straightforward, solid. Your
way of living is like your character; one knows
one can rely on you, that you are a thoroughly
honourable and reliable man."</p>

<p>Again George was embarrassed. "Olga, Olga,
why these expressions of affection after so long
an acquaintanceship?"</p>

<p>"To-day is just the right moment," she
replied, and then with some confusion she added:
"This very day, three months ago, I met you
for the first time."</p>

<p>"Are you sorry?"</p>

<p>She kissed his hand. "You&mdash;you&mdash;I&mdash;I am
awfully fond of you. How could I indeed be
sorry?" Then she continued very earnestly:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
"You know, for I have already told you, how
that blackguard of a lieutenant treated me, and
I swore henceforward to be an honourable woman
and to have nothing to do with a man. I kept
to my resolution for a year. Well, what happened
then? Then there came along someone
whom I liked very much, and who was very
good and kind to me. You know it is very
difficult to be respectable on the stage; we
inferior ones are always envious of the 'stars'
who go about in silk and satin, and who frequently
cannot act any better than the others, and who
only owe their position to a rich friend who
pays for their dresses and arranges with the
director and manager that his <i>prot√©g√©e</i> shall be
brought out and given a good part. Well, that's
how it is, and besides one wants to enjoy one's
life; everybody does the same, not only those
who are on the stage. We are not the worst;
the others who do it all secretly and pose as
highly respectable young women, they are really
the worst."</p>

<p>"Now, now, Olga, take a glass of wine. Why
do you get into a temper? Do be cheerful again."</p>

<p>After a short struggle her naturally kindly
disposition got the upper hand. "You are quite
right. I cannot alter what has already happened,
but still the lieutenant was a blackguard;
you remember I told you he shot himself later,
and that was the best thing he could do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be so hard, Olga."</p>

<p>"Pray do not stand up for him," she went on
angrily. "I know what you feel: that if a
young girl accepts an invitation from an officer
she must know quite well what to expect. But
I was very young and inexperienced then."</p>

<p>"But, Olga, I cannot understand you to-day.
What is the matter with you? Why do you
insult the officers in this way. You remember
I am one."</p>

<p>"Ah, you," she said tenderly. "You are not
really one of them. You are much too honourable.
You are a man, the others are stuck-up
apes, and besides that, generally liars and betrayers."</p>

<p>"Olga, I beg you with all seriousness to cease
making these remarks. Whatever is the matter
with you? Shall we stay here or go into the
sitting-room?" he asked her presently.</p>

<p>"Let us go into the sitting-room," she replied.
She loved the large beautiful room with its
splendid carpet, heavy <i>porti√®re</i> and the fine
pictures. Best of all she loved the large comfortable
leather seat in front of the fire, and
every time that she visited George she meant to
ask him to let her sit in that chair after dinner.
She had never done so, because on every occasion,
to-day included, directly they went into the
sitting-room George drew out the <i>chaise longue</i>
for her, put a cushion under her head, and covered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
her with a great bear rug. He always did this,
and treated her with so much love and such
tender consideration that she had not the heart
to tell him how uncomfortable she was.</p>

<p>"Are you comfortable, darling?"</p>

<p>Again, from affection, she told him an untruth:
"Simply lovely."</p>

<p>He kissed her tenderly, handed her a cigarette,
took a cigar for himself, and then sat down on
a chair by her side.</p>

<p>"You do live in a splendid way, George.
You can't imagine how happy I feel when I am
with you."</p>

<p>"Because you are in my rooms, or because
you are with me?"</p>

<p>"Because I am in your rooms, naturally,"
she said teasingly. "Why ever should I care
about you? You are an old cynic who does
not deserve that I should like him so much and
be so nice to him. Oh, you dear old silly, come
here, and let me give you a kiss. Well, now,
that will do, be sensible and sit down nicely and
tell me what you have been doing lately. What
parties have you been to, and with whom have
you danced? Whom did you go for your cure
with?"</p>

<p>George answered and asked questions. Olga
showed a real and sincere interest in everything
that concerned him; he knew that he could
entirely trust her, and that later, when they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
parted, she would make no use of anything
he had told her, and so he spoke quite frankly
to her. He told her about the regiment, his
parents, and his sister, but naturally enough
he never spoke a word about Hildegarde. He
had not once mentioned her name, and to-day
likewise he was silent on the subject. Not
indeed that he feared Olga would be jealous;
she was too sensible and intelligent for that,
and, moreover, she had often said she wished
he would marry a lovely and beautiful wife.
In spite of all that, however, an inexplicable
feeling prevented his speaking about Hildegarde
to her.</p>

<p>Olga listened to him attentively; many of
the names of the people in Society were familiar
to her, she remembered them from his former
accounts, and she showed by her questions now
and again that she was following him with real
interest. Naturally she was most interested in
knowing what the ladies wore, but she did not get
much information from him on this point.</p>

<p>"How can you be so foolish as not to notice
these things?" she scolded him. "A woman
is most interested in what another woman has
on."</p>

<p>"Or rather what she has <i>not</i> on," he said
mockingly.</p>

<p>The entrance of the servant put an end to
their conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"A letter has just come for you, sir."</p>

<p>"Any answer?"</p>

<p>"The messenger did not say anything, he
did not wait."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>The servant disappeared and George held
the note a moment in his right hand unopened.</p>

<p>"Who is it from?" inquired Olga.</p>

<p>"I do not know how it is, but a vague feeling
tells me that this letter contains something
unpleasant for me."</p>

<p>"Shall I read it to you then? If I think
the contents will vex you I will tear it up and
never tell you what was in it."</p>

<p>He kissed her hand. "You are a dear little
thing, but I am afraid that won't do. Well,
let us see what it is."</p>

<p>He opened the envelope with a paper-knife,
turned over the sheet and looked at the signature.
A slight triumphant smile played round his mouth.
"Ah, ha, Willberg, I said so!"</p>

<p>Olga had risen and was leaning her head
on her right hand; now she looked at George
anxiously and expectantly. "Willberg, what does
he want of you? You told me once how oddly
he behaved to you. Why does he write you?"</p>

<p>Instead of an answer George handed her the
letter, and Olga read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockq">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Winkler</span>,&mdash;Although I am still deep
in your debt, and am no more able to discharge it
to-day than I was weeks ago, yet I am forced
once more to ask you for help, and that as
promptly and swiftly as possible. To-day we
have been gambling simply frightfully. I lost
five thousand marks&mdash;four thousand to the Uhlan,
on whom I wanted to take my revenge. I must
pay this four thousand marks by to-morrow
morning, otherwise I must leave the army. I
do not know where to get the money from;
you are my only means of salvation. You have
so often offered me money that I feel quite sure
you will not now leave me in the lurch.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will have the goodness to send
the money along by your servant Fritz, your
man, or any other human being you like. I
shall stay at home and await your answer. I
thank you most heartily beforehand for once
more getting me out of a terrible scrape.&mdash;With
sincere regards, yours gratefully,</p>

<p class="toright">"<span class="smcap">F. von Willberg</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>Olga folded up the letter and returned it to George.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"The letter is simply a model," she opined,
"short, polite, and childishly <i>na√Øve</i>. 'I have
been gambling, please pay my debts. The
man writes with a nonchalance and a coolness
as if he asked you to take a glass of wine with
him. Willberg is simply delicious."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you are not far wrong," said George,
who felt somewhat hurt by the tone of the
letter. "A young lieutenant, who has nothing
in the world to call his own but an allowance of
a few pounds, sits down with the greatest confidence
at the card-table and gambles away a
¬£50 bank-note, one after the other. When he
has come to the end of his ready money he plays
for credit, and when the game is over and he is
deeply involved, he sits down calmly and writes
to his friends and acquaintances: 'Please be
so good as to pay my debts.' And if he knows
that he can get no help from these sources,
because he has already exhausted them, then
he applies to any rich man whom perhaps he has
only met twice in his life, and borrows from him
with a <i>na√Øvet√©</i> and a shamelessness that is inimitable.
He knows quite well that he must get the
money somewhere. If matters do not go so
smoothly as he anticipated, he becomes melodramatic,
talks about leaving the regiment,
abandoning the army, Courts of Honour, a
bullet through his head, and such things. And
there are very few people who are not moved
when it is a question of saving, as they say,
a young and promising human life&mdash;which in
most cases is not worth the value of the bullet.
And so they put their hands in their pocket
and give the lieutenant what he needs to set
him on his legs again and be once more an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
'honourable' man. I do not know if you will
understand what I am going to say, Olga, but the
greatest misfortune for our lieutenants is&mdash;I
do not say our officers, but only our lieutenants&mdash;that
on account of their uniform and position
they can get credit everywhere. Many educated,
or only half-educated, rich people who gladly
entertain the officers, so that they may be considered
in 'Society,' constantly press their
assistance upon these lieutenants just on the
chance of their getting into difficulties. The
lieutenant sees it all quite clearly; he says to
himself: 'I get into debt, somebody else will
pay.' And our lieutenants will remain as they
are, and will never alter until they are no longer
given credit; he will only change when people
are no longer foolish enough to lend money
to every lieutenant who wants it."</p>

<p>"And do you suppose that day will come?"</p>

<p>"It will come when the world ceases to see
in every man who wears a uniform a marvellous
creature."</p>

<p>"Then that will be never."</p>

<p>"I almost believe you are right," he agreed
with her; and then, becoming even more serious,
he went on: "You know it's very hard on our
lieutenants, for, <i>au fond</i>, there is good stuff in
them, but they get frightfully spoiled and petted.
Officers are forbidden to contract debts just as
they are forbidden to gamble; but nobody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
troubles in the least about these prohibitions,
which are known, not only to the officers themselves,
but to everybody in Society and to the
tradesmen. But, just as in a club a civilian
would never dream of saying to a lieutenant,
'Sir, I do not wish to be discourteous, but I
know that His Majesty has forbidden the officers
to play cards,' so no tradesman would think
of saying to a lieutenant, 'I am not allowed to
give you goods on credit; I know you are not
allowed to contract debts.' The lieutenant alone
is not to blame. Society and the tradesman,
who not only make it possible for him to evade
the law, but also help him to do it quite easily,
and even lead him into doing so are largely
responsible for the fact that our officers of to-day,
in regard to manners and morals, are no longer
what they once were and what they will have
to be again." And then, half-seriously, half-laughingly,
he concluded, "Did you understand
all I was talking about, you dear little duffer?"</p>

<p>"Every word, and you are quite right."</p>

<p>"I only wish that other people would think
so too," he said, somewhat amused; "but I
believe that if one of the 'Golden Butterflies'
had heard my remarks he would have said
I was out of my mind, summoned me before a
Court of Honour on account of my seditious
words, and then I should have been asked,
'If you think like this, why did you become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
an officer?' I could only answer, 'When a
man enters upon a career he knows nothing
about it. Indeed, he <i>can</i> know nothing about
it. The knowledge of what it means to be
an officer only comes with the course of years.'
I have had my apprenticeship. I have gone
through the world with fairly wide-open eyes,
and have kept my ears on the alert, and I must
say that had I known earlier what it was like
among our officers, had I had the faintest conception
of their behaviour, of the way in which
they ran up debts, of the discontent with military
matters, the bitterness and hatred against the
authorities, the poverty and the misery, I should
have thought twice before donning a uniform."</p>

<p>"But why do you keep it on?"</p>

<p>George gazed at the clouds of smoke for a
little while, then he asked her, "Are you quite
sure, my dear child, you are not really bored
with all this discussion?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," she cried out quickly; "I
could lie here for hours and listen to you."</p>

<p>"Very well then, I will answer your question,
which I have been thinking about for a long
time, much longer than anyone would believe.
The reason why I still wear the officer's uniform
is, in my case, short and to the point&mdash;pride."</p>

<p>"Pride!" she asked with astonishment.</p>

<p>"You know, of course, how I have been
treated in the regiment. I have never made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the least mystery about it to you. If I were
to take off my uniform now, the 'Golden Butterflies'
would have attained the object they had
desired from the very first&mdash;they would have
got rid of me, they would again be among themselves;
their aristocratic society would be again
without spot or blemish. I am not going to
give them that triumph, which would mean
defeat for me. I am not a fighter, but I have
my ambition and my honourable feelings, and
I intend to see if I cannot make a proper position
for myself in the regiment. How often do I not
long for a chance of distinguishing myself in
some way or other, of doing something out of
the ordinary&mdash;but in vain. So I must try to
win a position by scrupulous fulfilment of my
military duties, diligence and reliability. Do
you imagine I have a pleasant life here? I am
young, I am rich, and though I am no spendthrift,
still I should like to enjoy my youth a
little more than I do. I should like to live on
a bigger scale, keep horses, and carriages, and
servants, go travelling about, and so on. I
know perfectly well what I should do, but I
simply dare not. If the adjutant of the regiment,
Count Wettborn, did all this, the officers would
be proud of the nobleman who knew how to
represent them in so splendid a fashion: everybody
would be delighted that he had the means
of living in a manner so suitable to his rank.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
They would praise the aristocrat; they would
find fault with me. If I lived in grand style,
only one word would be applied to me&mdash;snob.
And short work is always made with a snob.
He is not wanted in a regiment in which the
other officers are supposed to live economically,
but who, in reality, are over head and ears in
debt. My so-called ostentation and snobbery
would be an excellent reason for getting rid of
me, and I don't want that. I do not myself
believe that my life as a lieutenant will be a
long one; but whenever I do go, I shall be able
to tell myself and the others why I am going. <i>I</i>
shall hold my head high, but <i>they</i> will be covered
with shame, if, indeed, they are capable of
feeling shame."</p>

<p>Olga saw the deep furrows on his brow, and
she noticed his intense emotion.</p>

<p>"George," she begged in a gentle voice, "come
here to me, let me kiss you, do not get so angry
about these officers."</p>

<p>"My darling, it is all very well for you to talk&mdash;not
get angry indeed! To-day seems specially
appointed for the revelation of all kinds of things
which have hitherto been kept silent. I may
as well tell you, therefore, that I suffer frightfully
in my present surroundings, yet I am
conscious of no other fault but that of belonging
to the middle-class. If, indeed, these aristocratic
gentlemen were free from all faults and failings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
if they were really superior in military and other
duties, if the officers were in very truth what they
ought to be&mdash;an example of chivalry and honour;
if they possessed nobility, not only of birth
but of feeling and disposition, then I would not
hesitate for a moment. I would say to them
frankly and freely: 'I feel that my presence is
unwelcome to you. From the modern and
enlightened point of view I do not in the least
understand your standpoint, but in spite of
that I honour you, and I will no longer be an
annoyance to you.' But consider how matters
really stand? Of course, there are exceptions,
honourable exceptions everywhere, and it would
indeed be sad if there were not any among the
nobility. I can only judge, however, by what
I have seen myself, and I must say that in their
mode of life and interest in their military duties,
the most aristocratic officers are not one whit
superior to my <i>bourgeois</i> comrades, whom they
look down upon with such contempt. And
what a protection a title is! The world, which
nowadays is more or less democratic, is not to
have the pleasure of seeing an aristocrat sentenced
to punishment, the people are not to be given
the joy of saying: 'After all, these noblemen
are just like other people.' In every way a
nobleman has all kinds of advantages, not
because he <i>does</i> anything particularly wonderful,
but simply because, according to old women's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
tales, he <i>is</i> something wonderful. And one
can no more fight against this than against
stupidity. I get so enraged about this, that
in spite of my uniform I am almost inclined to
be a social democrat. I see more and more
how the middle-class person is more or less
regarded as a creature whose only justification
for existing is that he forms the dark background
which shows up the nobleman so brilliantly
and gloriously."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, George," cried out Olga, quite
frightened, "I don't know you when you are
in this mood; I have never heard you speak,
boy, so bitterly before."</p>

<p>"I am not bitter now, I assure you. What
I told you was not said on the spur of the moment,
but is the result of much thought and mature
and keen observation. But now let us stop
speaking about these serious things. I will
just go and send off the money to this noble
Willberg, and then, my darling, I am entirely at
your disposal."</p>

<p>He rose from his seat to go to his writing-desk,
but Olga held him back. "Will you do me a
favour, George. You know I have never asked
you for anything important, but this time it is.
Will you grant it me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if I can. Why not? I am very
fond of you."</p>

<p>"And I am very fond of you; it is just because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
of that I ask you to give me your word that you
will do what I want."</p>

<p>"My darling, how can I do such a thing?
One must not pledge his word of honour lightly;
you know perfectly well I would do anything for
you if I could. Now what is it?"</p>

<p>She had risen from her reclining position, and
looked at him entreatingly, her eyes dilating.
She was quite white from mental excitement,
and her voice trembled as she said: "Do me
the favour, and don't send the money to Willberg."</p>

<p>He regarded her with intense astonishment.
"Why ever not? The money is lying idle here,
and even if I hadn't it myself I could easily get
it. I have constantly offered Willberg my help;
I must certainly give it him now. Besides, it is
a great satisfaction to me, as you will understand,
that he should have to apply to me again. You
don't want to spoil my pleasure, do you?"</p>

<p>And he turned to go, but Olga kept him back.
"George, give your money to whomsoever you
like&mdash;do with it whatever you like&mdash;it is no
concern of mine, but you must not help Willberg.
Do you understand? You ought not to
help him!"</p>

<p>She spoke with such resolution and determination
that he went up to her and seized her hand;
he noticed how she trembled, and a feeling of
nervous excitement took possession of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Olga, you are keeping silent about something;
you must have reasons which you are
concealing from me, but I insist on knowing
everything. When you ask me not to help Willberg,
and tell me that I ought not to help him,
you must also tell me the reason why."</p>

<p>She looked at him with an expression of profound
love. "Do not ask me, do not torture
me, I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>"And what if I insist?" He also had become
deadly pale, and he held her hand in an iron
grip. "I insist upon knowing&mdash;do you understand?
You must not utter a half complaint,
but you must have the courage to tell the whole
truth. I have always considered you an honourable,
faithful and upright person&mdash;don't show
me I have made a mistake."</p>

<p>A mighty conflict raged within her as she stood
by him; her eyes were cast down, her whole
body trembled, and she was swayed and tossed
about by terrible mental struggles. Then she
raised her eyes and looked at him frankly and
openly. "Very well, then, you shall know all,
but only on one condition."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"That you give me your word of honour not
to tell Willberg a word of what I am going to
tell you. There is no reason why you should
not do that."</p>

<p>He regarded her doubtfully. "Is that really so?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she looked him straight in the face. "Yes,
but, in spite of this, if you are ever in a situation
when you can no longer keep your promise,
then I will release you after eight days&mdash;no
more nor less; till then, you can quietly think
over what I have to say to you." And after a
little while she asked him, in a hesitating tone
of voice, "Do you really insist that I am to tell
you everything, when the result may be that
we separate, and are never more friends?"</p>

<p>A dark suspicion arose in his mind. "You
were once on intimate terms with Willberg?"
he asked with excitement, but then, more calmly,
he went on: "But I could not very well be
angry with you about that, for you could not
have possibly known then that we should ever
have met."</p>

<p>Olga bit her lips in fury. "I know that only
too well. I told you that the villain who betrayed
me took his life soon after. That was not true;
he is still living, and his name is Willberg."</p>

<p>George fell back as if he had been struck,
then he sprang up and seized Olga by the shoulders.
"Tell me, it is not true&mdash;it cannot be true."</p>

<p>She freed herself from his grasp. "Come,
George, be reasonable; what has happened
cannot be altered now."</p>

<p>He sank into a chair and buried his face in
his hands. "What a blackguard!" he said,
gnashing his teeth, "what a blackguard!"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
And suddenly springing up, he demanded:
"Swear on your oath&mdash;have you still any connection
with him, or does he know that we are
intimate?"</p>

<p>"I am perfectly faithful to you," she answered
him calmly, and he knew from the tone of her
voice that she was speaking the truth. "I have
only seen Willberg once since."</p>

<p>"And when was that?" he asked, with great
excitement.</p>

<p>"On the very day that I met you for the first
time. He sent me a letter, saying he must see
me without fail on a matter that concerned my
own interests. At first I did not mean to answer
him, but when I read the letter again, I felt sure
that it really was a matter of serious importance.
So I named an hour when I would be at home
to him. And he came."</p>

<p>"Go on," urged George, as she was silent for
a moment. "What did this honourable gentleman
want with you?"</p>

<p>"He said he had quite by chance seen us
together one evening, and had followed us unobserved&mdash;I
had no ground for denying my
acquaintanceship with you; indeed, I could not,
in view of what he had seen&mdash;and he entreated
me most imploringly not to mention his name
to you. I had never intended to do so, and
had formerly made up my mind to be silent
concerning his name, but, in spite of that, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
appeared as if I were greatly astonished, and
asked why he made such a request?"</p>

<p>"And what did he answer?"</p>

<p>"He said that he must admit that he had
not treated me quite fairly that night."</p>

<p>"'Quite fairly'&mdash;that is splendid!" sneered
George.</p>

<p>"He knew that he ought to have given me
some compensation, but he was not then in a
position to do anything for me. Now he offered
me one thousand marks, partly as hush-money
for the future."</p>

<p>"Did you take the money?"</p>

<p>"Before his very eyes I threw it into the
blazing fire, and rejoiced in his look of horror.
After that he returned to the object of his visit.
He begged me not to tell you what had happened.
He and you were in the same regiment, I ought
not disturb the friendship which existed between
you. Probably you would not think he had
acted quite rightly (so he said), it might lead
to a quarrel. Such a thing is very disagreeable,
especially in a proud and distinguished regiment,
which, more than all others, must preserve outward
appearances. And, besides, you could not
fight a duel on my behalf. To cut the story
short, I don't remember what else he said; I
listened to him without answering a word, and
the longer I was silent the more humble and
pitiable he became, till at last he stood before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
me like a schoolboy who has been severely rebuked.
He fell on his knees, begged my pardon, and
entreated me to keep silence; it was then that
I promised never to mention his name to you.
To-day I have given his name, but I was compelled.
It is your fault, not mine, for I spoke
on your account. You may be sure I don't
want to run the risk of losing you because of him."
Suddenly she was overcome with anguish that
now she would be repulsive and hateful in his
sight; she sprang towards him and fell on her
knees. "George, tell me you still love me, that
you will not send me away&mdash;it was not my fault."</p>

<p>He bent over her and kissed her on the forehead.</p>

<p>"Get up, dear, why should I be angry with
you, indeed? How could I hold you responsible
for what a villain did, and it's not your fault
that his name is Willberg? But he shall answer
for what he has done."</p>

<p>"He must not do that," cried Olga; "you
have given me your word to tell him nothing
about it, and you will keep it, for I do not believe
that any occasion will arise to make me absolve
you from your promise."</p>

<p>He sank into a chair and looked gloomily in
front of him. Had he the slightest ground for
proceeding against Willberg? He might of
course say to him: "I know a young girl, and
am aware that you have treated her like a blackguard."
Willberg could not possibly allow this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
insult to pass unnoticed; there would be, at
the least, a quarrel, probably a duel, and, as a
result, an investigation by a Court of Honour.
A good deal of dirt would be thrown about,
but what would be the use of that? Willberg
would most likely be dismissed from the army,
and what then? What advantage would that
be to anybody? There would be one less dishonourable
man in the army certainly, but who
would have to bear the consequences of that?
Only George, for he would never be pardoned
for having acted so harshly towards the darling
of the regiment. Willberg after his dismissal
would still find faithful friends enough who would
help him. He would not suffer too excessively
in no longer wearing officer's uniform. No,
George could take no steps against him, he had
no case against him; he was obliged to admit
to himself that personally Willberg had done
him no harm, no injury, and if he stepped in on
behalf of Olga's honour, the town and the world
would shake their heads, and the colonel would
make it quite clear to him that men do not fight
a duel on account of a young woman like Olga.
She was certainly an excellent, worthy young
woman, she was under a talented actress, but
still&mdash;in imagination George heard their remarks,
and he doubled up his fists in a fury of rage.
Then another thought occurred to him. What
would his parents, what would Hildegarde say,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
when they learnt that he had fought a duel for
the sake of his mistress? They must not know
anything whatever about the matter.</p>

<p>For nearly five minutes George sat deeply
immersed in thought, and Olga watched his
expression with intense anxiety: her reputation,
her career, were at stake. What had taken
place between her and Willberg was known
only to themselves and George; she had told no
one about it; she had never mentioned the
name of her betrayer. If George thought the
affair ought not to rest with him, and that he
ought to inform the Court of Honour concerning
it, then she would be forced to absolve him
from his promise, and the whole town would
learn in a few days what up till to-day was a
secret. She would not be able to remain in
Berlin; she felt that she could never again face
an audience who knew how she had been treated.</p>

<p>"Well, George," she said at last, "have you
yet made up your mind what you are going to
do?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered firmly, "the blackguard
deserves to be struck in the face, but I shall not
do that; I shall not say a word of what you have
told me to anyone, not even to him, however
difficult it may be for me. But I am obliged
to act thus on your account, for I care too much
about you to expose you to public discussion,
public gossip, and probably to universal con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>demnation,
for the world must have suddenly
changed if in spite of everything it does not
hold you to blame. But as I have just said, I
will not do so, and so there's an end of the matter."</p>

<p>She clung to him and put her arm round his
neck.</p>

<p>"Thank you, George."</p>

<p>He led her to the <i>chaise longue</i> and sat down
by her side. "Good God, what filth! There
is just one thing I should like to know. Do
you happen to remember the day&mdash;I mean the
date when this&mdash;this&mdash;creature came to you
and entreated you to keep silence?"</p>

<p>"How could I not remember it?" she said
teasingly, trying to restore him to a happier
frame of mind: "don't you know I just told
you it was the day after I first met you. Surely,
George, you have not forgotten <i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>He knitted his brow. "Don't be vexed,
Olga, but my brain is in such a whirl just now
that I simply can't remember a thing."</p>

<p>She took from her finger a diamond ring which
he had given her in remembrance of their first
meeting, on which the date was engraved. Then
she handed it to him.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, how could I have forgotten
it!" He was suddenly thoughtful, and then
he jumped up with a start.</p>

<p>"What is the matter now?" she asked,
frightened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing," he assured her; "I
just remembered that when Willberg came to
me for the first time to borrow money, he must
have known of our relations. He had seen
you, and yet he had the audacity to come to
me. Now it's all clear to me; now I understand
why he begged me so urgently not to say a
word to anyone; he feared that perhaps I
would tell you, and that then it would come
out how he had treated you. Of course, that
was it!"</p>

<p>He strode up and down the room, occupied
with his own thoughts.</p>

<p>"George," Olga begged; "do me the favour
of writing a few words to Willberg. Tell him
you cannot give him the money, and then forget
the hateful story."</p>

<p>George stood still. "You are right; Willberg
is waiting for news. I forgot all about
that; and the forms of politeness must be preserved,
however difficult it may be."</p>

<p>He wrote a few lines, in which he regretted that
he was not at the moment able to place the
money desired at his friend's disposal, and then
he sent his servant with the note.</p>

<p>"One thing worries me," said George: "I
do not know if I have enough self-control and
strength of mind to meet Willberg calmly to-morrow
and act as if I was not aware of his
shameful behaviour."</p>

<p>"Can't you keep out of his way. He is in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
another company, I know, and is he not in a
different battalion?"</p>

<p>"That is so, but of course I meet him at mess,
and even if I do not meet him to-morrow I shall
have to the next day, for we may not absent
ourselves from the mess dinner for more than
two days without an adequate reason. I fear
that my blood may not be sufficiently cool by
then."</p>

<p>Olga thought for a moment, then she asked:
"Cannot you get leave of absence? I should of
course be very sorry not to see you for a week or
a fortnight, but a holiday would do you good;
you would enjoy yourself and have a change of
thought. You could easily get leave, I should
think."</p>

<p>"That is so," he agreed, "there is not much
doing just at present, and they could not refuse
me leave of absence, but where should I go?
Home? I don't want to see my father and mother
just now. I could not be light-hearted and
gay, and they would notice that something
depressed me; my coming would upset them
instead of delighting them."</p>

<p>"I know," cried Olga suddenly: "You said
just now you would like to enjoy your life. Go
for a fortnight to Paris, to Monte Carlo, or anywhere
else where it is delightful, and when you
see beautiful women, give them my greeting,
and tell them they are to be good and kind to
you; I shall not be jealous." And then with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
roguish laugh she added: "You know you will
not remain faithful to me."</p>

<p>"I shall," he said firmly.</p>

<p>"No, no," she answered laughingly. "I wager
anything you won't."</p>

<p>"But I shall have no chance of being unfaithful
to you."</p>

<p>She looked at him astonished. "How do
you mean? For what reason?"</p>

<p>"For the simplest of all reasons&mdash;you will
come with me."</p>

<p>"George!" Laughing and crying with joy,
she flung her arms round his neck. "You will
take me with you? I shall see Paris or some
other beautiful town? George, you are really
too good and kind," and she kissed him again
and again. Suddenly she stopped.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"I cannot go with you."</p>

<p>"Why ever not?"</p>

<p>"You shall not be able to say that I persuaded
you into taking a holiday for my own advantage;
besides, I do not know if I can get permission
to go."</p>

<p>"The first reason is absurd," he said. "I
am not so sure if it will be a pleasure to come
with me, but you give me great happiness by
your company. Nothing is more unpleasant,
at least to me, than to travel alone, to sit in
a carriage by oneself, to have meals alone, to
wander through the museums and galleries alone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and to have no one with whom one can discuss
things. There will be no difficulty about getting
permission; just now you are not very busy
at the theatre."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;the <i>r√©pertoire</i> may be changed
any day."</p>

<p>"Dear child," he assured her, "your director
is not a brute. To-morrow ask him to give
you leave of absence, and if he makes any difficulties
tell him you are prepared to pay two to
three thousand marks' compensation if he will
absolve you from a fortnight's duty. I assure
you he will give you a holiday for as long as
you like."</p>

<p>She seized hold of his hand and kissed it
gratefully. "How dear and kind you are.
Do you mean you will pay so much money to
free me from my engagement? But I can tell
you I shall first offer five hundred marks, then
another five hundred, and so on, but under no
circumstances will I give more than two
thousand."</p>

<p>He laughed gaily. "You can do as you like
as regards that. I will give you the money at
once. Whatever you have over belongs to you,
of course."</p>

<p>She clapped her hands with joy. "I shall
buy a very elegant travelling costume with it."</p>

<p>"Don't do it, darling," he requested. "Whatever
you need in the way of dresses I will buy
you in Paris. During all the time that I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
been a lieutenant I have never spent half my
allowance, and so it has gone on accumulating.
Now I can spend a large sum of money without
any conscientious scruples."</p>

<p>"Shall we really go to Paris?" she asked,
with beaming eyes.</p>

<p>"If all goes well, to-morrow evening. We
will take my man with us. I can rely absolutely
on his silence. You will get in at the North
Station, I at the South. I will carefully examine
the train to see if any of my acquaintances are
in it, and I will have a carriage reserved for us,
so that we may travel in state. And if anybody
sees us together later on, what does it matter?
And, besides, who knows us in Paris?"</p>

<p>"Have you ever been there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He began to tell of the beauties and charms
of Paris, and, tenderly clinging to him, she
listened to his description of the delights which
she was to enjoy with him.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
  <span class="smcap">An Aristocratic Household</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Hildegarde's</span> father was about to celebrate
his sixtieth birthday, and the old major had
expressed a wish to see his two children on that
day. Fritz had naturally made use of this
occasion of rejoicing as an excuse for asking the
Warnows to lend him a good sum for travelling
expenses; of course he had to travel first-class,
and take his man with him, besides which he
really must give the old gentleman a nice present
for his birthday. So Captain von Warnow
had once more given him a ¬£50 note. Fritz,
thereupon, had naturally tried his luck at cards,
and he had the disgrace, as he himself called it,
of winning a couple of hundred pounds from
the owner of an estate in the neighbourhood;
this did not often happen to him; he beamed
with joy, and for the first time for many days
he found once more that life was still endurable.</p>

<p>Hildegarde at first did not want to make the
journey, she felt hurt at her father's letter, in
which he wrote: "My dear child, I should, of
course, be immensely delighted to see you, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
my personal wishes must not be considered if
there is anything important at stake. If you
cannot come, or find it unwise to go away now
for a few days, then stay where you are and strike
while the iron is hot."</p>

<p>She did not want to go, for she foresaw exactly
what would happen at home, but her aunt persuaded
her to take the journey. Winkler was
on furlough, so it was said, at Monte Carlo and
on the Riviera, he was not returning for a week.
There were no big entertainments before then,
and in any case, if Winkler were away, there
would be no object in going to them, it would
only mean the unnecessary expense of new
dresses. She had no desire to throw away her
money on men who had no serious intentions
with regard to her niece. And there was also
another reason why Frau von Warnow urged
Hildegarde to go; she wanted to be alone with
her husband again and to be able to do something
else during the week but worry and bother about
her engagement. She was thankful that George
and Hildegarde would be away at the same
time. In a week they would both be back,
and it was to be hoped that the matter would
soon be brought to a happy conclusion. She
felt perfectly satisfied that Lieutenant Winkler
was deeply interested in Hildegarde. When
George had announced his leave of absence to
her husband he had requested most earnestly
to be remembered to his wife and Hildegarde.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
It was quite irregular, from a military point of
view, and it was just because of that that Frau
von Warnow regarded it as a good sign.</p>

<p>So Hildegarde went home. She went by a
morning train and her parents met her at the
station. Fritz was expected in less than an hour,
and so they stayed at the station. They went
into the restaurant to have something to eat,
for Hildegarde was tired and hungry from the
long and wearisome journey on the branch
line.</p>

<p>The waiter hastened towards them, and the
proprietor himself came forward to see to their
orders. The major as an officer, and more
especially as a baron, was one of the great people
of the town; he was indeed the only actual
baron there, although there were a few more
or less old "Vons," and thus he played an important
r√¥le in the little town, although his
financial position was well known.</p>

<p>The major was the type of the retired military
man, of medium size, well-built, a somewhat
red face and enormous moustaches. His wife
was still an extremely nice-looking woman, and
one could see that in her youth she must have
been really beautiful.</p>

<p>They chattered about matters of indifference
till the meal was served, but Hildegarde noticed
only too clearly how impatient her parents were
to hear something about her prospective engagement;
she tried to avoid a conversation on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
subject, but was unsuccessful. Scarcely had
the waiter brought in the meal, and been given
the order not to come back till they rang for him,
when they both drew their chairs near to Hildegarde.
"Now, dear child, tell us all about it.
Relieve us of a great anxiety. How do matters
stand with you?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde parried the question; what could
she really say? It was certainly very likely
that George, when he had got to know her better,
would one day ask for her hand in marriage,
and that was the only thing she could say. But
she read in her parents' faces such fear, and
yet such hope, that she had not the heart to deprive
them of their joy. Suddenly she thought
of a way out of the difficulty. She briefly
referred to George, and then spoke at length
concerning another very rich man who had lately
paid her an immense amount of attention.</p>

<p>"But, dear child, your aunt has never told
me a word about this, and she always keeps me
informed as to the admirer of the hour."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is what she does," thought Hildegarde.
Then she said: "Mamma, I don't
want you to write to aunt about this; oddly
enough she hasn't noticed this gentleman's
attentions to me, and I did not tell her anything
about it. You know what aunt is; she means
to do the very best for me, and in her efforts
to help me, perhaps she goes too far and spoils
things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what is his name? What is he?"
inquired her mother.</p>

<p>Hildegarde blushed scarlet. "Please do not
ask me; I don't want to talk about it while
the thing is still so uncertain."</p>

<p>"Quite right, my child," commended the
major, "one ought not to talk about things until
they are settled"; and turning to his wife he
continued, "Do not press Hildegarde any more.
If she does not want to talk about it you may
be sure she has good reasons." Then he shook
hands with his daughter. "Thank you, dear
Hilda, that in honour of this day you give me <i>this
pleasure</i>; two celebrations instead of one. Ah, it
will probably soon be all settled"; and then he
added, with a deep sigh, "But it's high time, I can
tell you, Hilda, I could not hold out much longer."</p>

<p>Her mother also sighed and said gently:</p>

<p>"Hilda, you have no idea what terrible times
we have been through while you were in Berlin.
Just think of it, the municipal authorities were
about to issue a distress warrant for the taxes,
and your father had to strain every nerve to get
an adjournment."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, that was a stiff bit of work,
I can tell you, and if I had not been able to
make use of my well-known name, God knows
the fellow would have seized my last bit of furniture;
those people have no mercy."</p>

<p>"None to the common people, at any rate,"
Hildegarde interposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"And they are quite right," affirmed the
major; "the State cannot live without taxes,
and if it were to take under its protection every
working man and tradesman who is behindhand
with his taxes, where would that lead to? We
should soon run dry and have no money for
soldiers, pensions and other important things.
The State must be without mercy, and if it makes
an exception in our case it does so because it
knows perfectly well that it can do so; an
aristocrat always does his duty towards the
State and his fellow-creatures."</p>

<p>Hildegarde did not venture to contradict, she
could not indeed do so without convicting her
father of lying.</p>

<p>The major had finished his beer. "What a
miserable drink this is for lunch, it makes one
feel heavy and spoils one's appetite. What do
you say to our celebrating this meeting with
half a bottle of champagne?" His wife had no
wish to do so. She feared the expense; but,
on the other hand, she knew it was useless to
oppose him, and, perhaps, indeed it would help
to raise their credit a little if the proprietor of
the restaurant said that they had drunk champagne
and paid for it in cash. So she agreed.
"Yes, certainly, but please let it be French
champagne."</p>

<p>"Of course," said the major; "do you
suppose I would celebrate the joyful news
that Hilda brings us with miserable frothy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
German champagne?" and he called to the
waiter.</p>

<p>It was on Hildegarde's lips to say: "Spare
your money; you have no occasion to rejoice
in what I have just told you, it was a pure
fabrication." But she remained silent. Why
should she worry her parents? Perhaps somehow
or other a miracle would happen and it
would all come right in the end.</p>

<p>"No, bring a whole bottle of Pommery,"
corrected the major; "my son is soon coming,
he will also be thirsty, and it's not worth while
beginning with half a bottle."</p>

<p>The wine came, the glasses clinked, and Hildegarde
was asked to tell her news again. "Not
here," she begged; "there is no more uncomfortable
place to stay in than a waiting-room,
and especially in a little provincial town."</p>

<p>"All fancy, my dear child, all fancy," her
father informed her. "When I was a young
lieutenant I was once stationed at a miserable
hole which Satan, if he likes, may utterly destroy;
at last a station was built, and day after day we
strolled up there and felt as jolly and as comfortable
in the miserable little waiting-room as we
had never felt before. If we had not had that
station, and had not been able to go to the
station daily, I really do believe we could not
have endured the life for long; we should have
gone out of our minds. When we had done our
daily military duty the day's work was over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
for us, then there was only one thing to be
settled: when and how were we to go to bed?
Should we go early and sober, or late and drunk?
Now we had a higher object in life; we must
go and see the arrival and departure of the
trains, and we did this quite as conscientiously
as we did our other duties. You can't imagine
the joy when one of us by chance discovered an
acquaintance in the train; whether he liked
it or not he was hauled out of the carriage, and
if we could not do it otherwise we used force.
And once we had captured a guest, with much
craft and cunning, we didn't let him go easily,
I can assure you. He was, to a certain extent,
placed under military supervision so that he
could not escape. Our visitor had perfect
freedom; he could do whatever he liked, only
he must not go to the station. When at last he
really had to go away, and when he had showed
us most unmistakably that he really could
not stay away longer, we only let him off by
paying huge toll. Ha! ha! We were nothing
but highwaymen; but, good gracious, what
on earth could one do in such a dull hole of a
place?"</p>

<p>The major liked telling stories about his life
in the little garrison town, in which he appeared
to have much enjoyed himself in spite of his
grumbling and swearing. When he spoke of
the days when he was a young lieutenant he
nearly always began his description with, "We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
were gay dogs in these days," and then he winked
knowingly and smacked his lips in remembrance
of the jolly days when wine, women and dice
played the chief part. Probably the memory
of his life in the little garrison town was so
delightful because, to a certain extent, it was
merely an episode. Immediately after his marriage
he had been transferred to Berlin and had
taken a good position there because he was a
thoroughly good-natured man and an excellent
officer; his wife was regarded as the <i>belle</i> of
Society. A great career had been prophesied
for him, but one day all his prospects were
ruined in consequence of an unjust criticism at
inspection parade. The contemptuous tone in
which the General, before all the officers, criticised
the way he did his work made his blood boil,
and he so far lost his self-control as to say to
the General that, after all, he was only a human
being like himself, and that he could not admit
the justice of his remarks. This was more than
insubordination, and the major might consider
himself lucky that he escaped with dismissal
instead of being punished. He left the army, but
a little later the General was also dismissed; his
methods of criticism had also not been approved
of in higher quarters.</p>

<p>When the major began to tell of the days
when he was a lieutenant he went on from one
story to another, and though his womenfolk
had heard them all over and over again, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
listened attentively to him from affection; for
he had nothing on earth to do but tell these
stories of the gay or wearisome times he had had
as an officer. If, as now, he had a little champagne
by his side, everything in the past had
a golden halo around it; when he sat at home
with his money bothers he had not a good word
for the whole army.</p>

<p>At last the train which was to bring Fritz
was signalled.</p>

<p>The major looked into the bottle, it was empty;
he turned to the waiter to order another one,
when his womenfolk interposed. "Let us go
home when Fritz comes, it is much nicer there;
besides, we have to dress for dinner."</p>

<p>Grumbling, the major agreed. "Very well,
then, I must pay." He looked into his purse.
"Good gracious, I forgot to put in a five-pound
note. I have not enough money with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, that does not matter, sir," averred the
waiter; "the gentleman can pay when he
comes next time."</p>

<p>Hildegarde grew scarlet, she felt ready to
sink to the ground for shame; she knew the
trick so well, she had been witness innumerable
times when her father had forgotten the five-pound
note which, as a rule, he never possessed.
How had she forgotten about this for the
moment? Never, never should her father
remain in debt for a meal of which she had partaken.
So she opened her purse. "I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
some change, father. How much do you want?"
And without waiting for an answer she pushed
two gold coins towards the waiter.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's right, Hilda, only don't forget
to remind me to give you back the money directly
we get home."</p>

<p>The waiter was about to give her some change,
but Hildegarde did not take it. "That's all
right, keep the change for yourself."</p>

<p>They got up and went on to the platform.
"Hilda, how could you be so foolish as to pay,"
scolded the major; "to-morrow it will be all
over the town that you have come back with
money, and in honour of my birthday the people
will dun me for their accounts. One must either
pay all or nothing. I cannot do the first, so I
have all carefully noted down, and later I shall
settle the whole bodily at one go."</p>

<p>Hildegarde was vexed at this way of looking
at things. "What do you think about this,
mother?"</p>

<p>The baroness shrugged her shoulders. "I
should prefer to pay ready money for everything,
but as we cannot do that we must adopt
another method. But the people know very
well that they will get their money." And
drawing Hildegarde aside she asked in a whisper,
"Tell me, pray&mdash;I am consumed with anxiety
and I wonder your father has not yet asked
you&mdash;what did the Warnows send as a birthday
present?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Uncle sent by me a cheque for six thousand
marks (¬£300) on the local branch of the Imperial
Bank."</p>

<p>"Not more than that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma!"</p>

<p>Hildegarde could not speak. She herself was
more than humiliated by her uncle's kindness.
She had reckoned up what he had spent in the
course of years for her parents, Fritz and herself.
It is true he was very rich, and in spite of his
splendid way of living and all that he gave away
he did not live up to his income; but his kindness
had so greatly shamed and affected her that
she had long ago declined to accept any money
from him.</p>

<p>Her mother, absorbed in thought, walked to and
fro with Hildegarde, whilst her father inquired of
the station-master why the gate was not yet open.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "I fear your father will be
somewhat disappointed. I know that he secretly
reckoned upon ten thousand (¬£500). Six thousand
(¬£300) is, of course, a lot of money. Nobody
must know anything about it, or people will
try and get it out of us at once."</p>

<p>The arrival of the train brought the conversation
to an end, and Fritz hastened towards
his parents and sister and greeted them heartily.
He was in faultless civilian costume, which
betrayed the officer in every detail.</p>

<p>"How do you do, mamma? How do, papa?
How do, Hilda? How nice that we're all here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
together again! We'll celebrate the next few
days properly." He looked round for his servant.
"Where's the idiot? 'Pon my word,
these fellows get more idiotic every day. Ah,
there he comes."</p>

<p>The servant, in plain blue livery, appeared,
and Fritz handed him his luggage ticket.</p>

<p>"If you, thick-skinned brute, imagine that
I take you with me for your private pleasure,
then you have made a mistake. You are here
for me, do you understand? And if you dawdle
about here and don't do your damned duty,
then I'll have you shut up in barracks for a few
days and dismissed. Do you understand? Now,
look sharp and put the luggage in the carriage."</p>

<p>"At your service, sir." The servant hurried
out to fulfil his orders.</p>

<p>Hildegarde had noticed how the soldier had
blushed when his lieutenant had rated him in
this contemptuous manner before the ladies and
the other travellers. She said to her brother,
"Don't be so disagreeable to your servant.
Probably he has been looking forward to the
holiday. Don't spoil his pleasure for him."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter to me whether the fellow
enjoys himself or not. The important thing is
for me to be properly looked after, and, moreover,
I must beg you, courteously but emphatically,
not to give me instructions as to how I am
to treat my people. Do not interfere in things
that don't concern you. Tell me instead how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
things are with you. Are we soon to congratulate
you, eh?"</p>

<p>They had, meanwhile, taken their places in
the carriage. The luggage had been put in, the
servant mounted the box, and in a moment
the carriage drove off at a trot to the villa where
the major lived.</p>

<p>Hildegarde did not answer, and Fritz had
to repeat his question; but he read in his mother's
glance, which told him not to press his sister
further, that all was going on well, and he breathed
a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>After a short drive they reached their home,
and a little later they joined one another at
dinner. The major beamed with pleasure at
having his two children with him again, and in
honour of the day, and as a preparation for the
morrow, they had the best wines and the richest
food. After dinner they sat for a long time
over the coffee and cigars. The brother and
sister had to tell everything that had happened
to them, the former in his little provincial garrison,
the latter in Berlin.</p>

<p>Although the major loved his beautiful daughter
dearly, Fritz was certainly his favourite;
everything that he did was right, everything
that he said was marvellous.</p>

<p>Hildegarde, on the contrary, found her brother,
whom she had not seen for some time, more
intolerable than ever. He was amazingly proud
and conceited&mdash;the typical young officer who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
has nothing, is nothing, and yet solely on the
strength of his uniform imagines himself to be a
superior being. His appearance was as affected
as his behaviour; the waxed moustache standing
out proudly, the eyeglass which he never
for a moment removed from his eye, and his
up-to-date civilian's dress. He was really rather
nice-looking, his figure was slim and elegant,
and he had a fresh, open countenance, though
somewhat unintelligent and expressionless, and
he wore an affected air of boredom.</p>

<p>Of course he talked of nothing but his horses,
his duties, his comrades, and this bored Hildegarde
so that she got up on the pretext of going
to rest a little. Her mother also rose after she
had arranged with her daughter to pay some
visits in the afternoon.</p>

<p>As soon as father and son were alone together
it was: "What do you say if we were to drink
another bottle of wine?"</p>

<p>"I'm quite agreeable."</p>

<p>The wine was brought, and for a short time
they continued their former conversation, then
they spoke of Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"Really, how handsome the girl still is!"
said Fritz. "And do you think that this time
it will come off?"</p>

<p>To-day the major saw everything in roseate
hues. "Yes, most certainly. Hildegarde has
two on the cards; one in any case will come
up to the scratch."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Fritz groaned aloud. "God grant it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Heaven help us!" assented his father,
then he went on: "Well, now, as we clearly
see deliverance before us, you need no longer
keep any secrets from me, especially as you
know quite well that I cannot pay your debts.
I told you that directly you became an officer.
I said to you then: 'Have as many debts as
you like, but look to yourself for paying them.'
Now confess, how much do you owe?"</p>

<p>Fritz was for a moment embarrassed. "Do
you really want to know?"</p>

<p>"Why not? As I am not going to pay them
you may be quite sure I shall not reproach you."</p>

<p>Fritz bit another cigar. "Taking it all in
all, from first to last, it must be about forty
thousand marks."</p>

<p>"And how long have you been a lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"Seven years."</p>

<p>"Then that would be at the rate of about
six thousand a year; it can't be called a small
amount."</p>

<p>Fritz shrugged his shoulders. "What is one
to do? The life of an officer is expensive, and
then one is not born into the world simply to
perform one's military duties. One cannot
manage on the allowance you give me."</p>

<p>"Another perhaps might&mdash;you cannot."</p>

<p>"I don't think anyone else, at least no one
in my regiment, could; they are all in debt,
some more, some less. I should say that 75 per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
cent. of all the lieutenants from time to time
do confess to their parents, then a couple of
thousands or so are paid&mdash;naturally each time
they say it is the very last&mdash;and the son is once
more on his legs again. Now, if one multiplies
by seven the amount that the others pay yearly
in debts, it amounts to a pretty big sum of money.
With me the matter is somewhat more complicated,
because I have never paid a farthing,
and when one is in such a plight as I am one
naturally has to pay very high interest. The
last time, in spite of great skill and cunning,
I received a thousand marks when I gave an I O U
for three thousand."</p>

<p>"Still, that's something," laughed his father.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Fritz joined in the laugh, then
he became serious again and asked, "How are
things with you, father?"</p>

<p>The major smoked on furiously for a moment.
"Don't ask me, my son, things are very bad
indeed with me."</p>

<p>The old gentleman looked so full of despair
that Fritz felt sincere sympathy, "Poor father,
all will soon be better again."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; but will you believe it, that in
spite of the fact that I am not a man of prejudice,
I cannot bear the idea of accepting money from
my son-in-law, not only to pay my debts, but
in order to exist?"</p>

<p>Fritz looked at him with astonishment. "I
cannot understand it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is because you are a young lieutenant,
unmarried, and have no one in the world to look
after but yourself. But consider me, I am an
old man of sixty. For more than ten years
I have been pensioned; at eight I entered the
army as a cadet. I have therefore worn the
soldier's uniform for over forty years, and during
the whole time I have exercised and drilled
recruits, done my duty on parade, taken part
in three campaigns. And what is the result
of it all? To be dismissed with a pension on
which one cannot live if he has a wife and child.
Pensioned off with four thousand marks. I
ask you, what are four thousand marks to-day?
Now, things are said to be better, the pensions
are to be increased&mdash;well, let us say there is an
addition of one thousand five hundred marks&mdash;it
won't in any case be more, probably not so
much. What then? Even six thousand marks
are not sufficient to defray the household expenses
of a family, are they? In a little town,
perhaps, if one lives extremely modestly. But
has one grown old, has one worn out one's bones
for years in peace and in war, in order that in
one's old age one must suffer one deprivation
after another merely to prolong life? There is
an old saying that the sweets of youth are not a
good preparation for the black bread of old age.
And we pensioned officers in our youth tasted
mostly nothing but sweets. Certainly there were
notable exceptions who managed on their allow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>ance,
who were economical and sober, but most
lived in a happy-go-lucky fashion and enjoyed
all the pleasures that were offered them. And
what a position one enjoyed then, how one was
<i>f√™ted</i>! From one family to another, one dinner
to another. They always gave us the best of
everything, overwhelmed us with attentions,
literally begged and entreated for our favour.
And how well and luxuriously we lived at the
Casino. We ordered what we wanted, and if
we had no money we ran into debt. Then after
this youth of amusement and gaiety comes
sorrowful old age, in which one has nothing
whatever to do, though that is not the worst
part of it. Two things make old age unbearable;
money anxieties and the position to which
we are relegated. Who are we nowadays?
Mere nobodies! The stupidest young lieutenant
plays a far more important part than we. We
are on the shelf, no attention is paid to us; we
are either regarded as ridiculous figures or, at
any rate, as objects of pity. And so after we
have done our duty for years we can retire to
some miserable little hole where we are bored
to death or starve. For you can't imagine, my
boy, the way in which the pensioned officers
and their families live here, and, of course, it is
the same in every <i>pensionopolis</i>. There is a
groaning and a gnashing of teeth of which none
but the initiated have any idea. How few of
them ever have any opportunity of earning a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
few pence? People are apt to avoid the pensioned
officer, not entirely without justification,
and when he does try to get a post, how much
can he earn as an agent or traveller for wine?
It is a miserable life, a dog's life. Pour me
out some more wine, my boy, pass me the glorious
wine; we must gild the grey day, glorify it with
wine."</p>

<p>Father and son clinked glasses and emptied
them at a draught. Then Fritz said:</p>

<p>"You may be quite right in what you say,
father, but how can things be altered? It has
always been like this, and I suppose it always
will be."</p>

<p>"Yes, as long as the officer plays the important
part in Society that he does to-day."</p>

<p>Fritz looked up astonished.</p>

<p>"Do you then, as an officer, wish that it should
be otherwise?"</p>

<p>"In many ways, certainly. Do not misunderstand
me. I am far from wishing that the
position of the officer should be lowered. In
my opinion he must and ought to remain in the
view of the public what he is to-day&mdash;a man
belonging to the highest class of Society. That
is necessary if we desire to maintain our army
in the highest efficiency, as it still is&mdash;although
for a long time things have not been as they
ought to be&mdash;as it must be, and as it could be;
but these eternal inspections, the fear of dismissal
and the struggle for mere existence no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
longer permit of the careful military training
of our troops. However, that is another story."
Turning to his son: "Give me another glass
of wine, these long speeches make me thirsty,
but I must relieve myself once for all of what
I have on my mind."</p>

<p>Then, drinking off the contents of his glass
at a draught, he continued:</p>

<p>"Well now, my boy, aristocratic men should
really form the highest caste in the land, but to
do this they must be far more exclusive than
they are to-day. People are always talking about
the caste feeling of the officers, and it is solemnly
trotted out when it is a question of excluding
unwelcome elements from the officers' corps, or
when an officer strikes a civilian with his sword,
or whenever an officer fights a duel with a comrade
or anyone else. When the cry is raised
against them by the other classes the officers
always defend themselves with, 'Remember we
belong to the highest caste; we have our own
sense of honour, which you cannot understand;
our thoughts are not your thoughts, nor yours
ours, God be thanked!'</p>

<p>"But how are things really with this highest
caste? If they had their own special instincts
and characteristics, their own ideas of honour,
then they would not only <i>appear</i> 'first class,'
they really would be <i>it</i>. They ought to remember
the Emperor's words: 'The best society
for the officer is that of the officer.' But it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
is just this idea that you all object to, and now
I am coming to what I wanted to say. Consider
for a moment the society of the modern officer&mdash;I
am not here referring to low-class society&mdash;he
has far too much of it; people run after the
lieutenants, everybody who has a house invites
you officers, and what do you do? You accept
every invitation when there is nothing actually
against the host which makes social intercourse
in his house an absolute impossibility, and of
course that is rare. Wherever there is the
attraction of a dinner, a supper, an entertainment
of any kind, where the food is good and
the drinks plentiful, there the officers are to be
found, and it is solely for the sake of the excellent
fare that they visit these people with whom
they would not dream of sitting down to dinner
if they were not rich. To-day, alas! money
in the eyes of the officers ennobles. That proud
sense of honour which the highest class ought
to have should not judge a man according as he
is rich or poor, but solely as he is an honourable
man. I have often enough noticed how even
the old officers bow down to money, how they
try to win the favour of the rich, how they give
themselves endless trouble to get introduced
into a family where a good dinner and a rich
daughter is the attraction. Naturally, if an
officer behaves in this way he lowers himself
in the eyes of other people and arouses the
contempt and derision of all thoughtful men&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, father&mdash;&mdash;" interrupted the son.</p>

<p>"Let me finish first what I have to say. If
you have any right feeling you must agree with
me in what I have already said. But the chief
reason why the social condition of the officers
must be altered is, that owing to the present state
of affairs the officer no longer takes a pride and
a joy in his military duties, and is forced into
a quite false mode of living. If he goes night
after night to balls can he next day be fresh
for his duties? and if he daily swallows oysters
and champagne at other people's houses, naturally
he does not live at the Casino and in his own
home as economically and as simply as he ought
if he is to manage on his money and contract no
debts. He ought in these ways to act as a
shining example to other people, and be in
reality, and show that he is really, a first-class
man. I do not entirely blame the lieutenants,
but Society, and, above all, the military authorities.
These, in my view, ought to forbid their
officers to go into Society so tremendously.
Their warnings not to live beyond their means
are not enough, and likewise, it is not much
use to read out from time to time the stringent
Cabinet Order: 'In order to decrease the love
of luxury and pleasure it becomes the officers
to give a good example by their economical and
upright mode of life,' or some such words. The
officers might assert that they are economical
in the Casino, but then it is the rarest thing for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
an officer to be ruined by his actual extravagance
in barracks. It is Society that is answerable
for the lieutenants, Society which imbues him
with the idea, the crazy idea I might say, that
he is a creature specially favoured by the Almighty,
who instil into him the poison of 'You
are quite different from every one else.' Society
drives him into making debts and living gaily
upon them, just as the rich do. When you are
an old pensioned officer as I am, without money
or position, you will see and understand how
Society sins against you by spoiling you in
this way. Yes, and when one is a young lieutenant
one is foolish enough to believe that all
these invitations are meant as an honour to
oneself personally, instead of, as it really is,
to the officer's uniform."</p>

<p>"That's not always so," interrupted his son.</p>

<p>"Always, as far as lieutenants are concerned,
I bet you any amount. It is well known to
you that the late Emperor Frederick had signed
a Cabinet Order commanding his officers to
wear uniform only when on duty; on other
occasions they were to appear in civilian dress.
I will not criticise in any way this Imperial
command, which is not yet in force, but if it
were in force, one thing I can tell you&mdash;with
one stroke it would have robbed the lieutenants
of their social importance. The young girls
would be bitterly disappointed, and the Enfeld
Hussars would not then be in such great request.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Now, after what I have told you, do you not see
that the carrying out of this order would have been
for the benefit of the officers in many ways?"</p>

<p>Fritz had been listening to his father with
astonishment, and now he said: "But what
sort of a life do you think we ought to live?
Without amusements or social intercourse we
could not exist, we should grow stupid and dull."</p>

<p>"Don't you imagine it, my boy," laughed
the old man. "Confess, honestly, do you ever
talk about anything sensible at these entertainments?
You speak, and that is all, you whisper
sweet words, or talk gossip to one another, but
have you ever talked about one serious subject
at any place where you have been to? You
could not indeed do that, for you are far too
stupid. Don't be offended at my harsh words,
but I am quite right in what I say. No one,
however, ought to reproach you with your
stupidity. The majority of officers have been
cadets, and what do you learn in the army?
Drill, riding, how to judge a horse, manners and
behaviour, but what else? What is added in
the way of knowledge is not worth talking about,
but it's considered quite sufficient for an officer.
I have been in the army and I can tell you that
I have often felt horribly, horribly ashamed
when I saw how little I knew that an educated
man ought to know. It is the rarest thing in
the world nowadays for a young officer to go
on with his education. If he ever does study<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
it's simply military subjects, and except for
this he is only too delighted when his duties
are over to take his ease or to fill himself with
alcohol, and I must say the last occupation is
by no means the worst. Pass along the wine,
my boy," and again the glasses clinked.</p>

<p>"Let me see, what was I just saying?"
asked the major. "Oh, yes, I remember. Well,
you see, your intellectual education ought not
to be of a kind to make you long to go to entertainments
and festivities; on the contrary, if
you were better educated you would feel how
boring it is to dine to-day at the Mullers, to-morrow
at the Schulzes, and to dance about
with young girls; you could easily dispense
with the <i>conversation</i>, I'll be bound, but not
with the dinners and the girls."</p>

<p>"But what do you want, then, father? I
really don't understand you. Almost every
week one reads in the papers of some scandal or
other that has taken place in a little garrison
town. Either two drunken lieutenants have
boxed each other's ears, or have carried on
with each other's wives, or there is some other
addition to the <i>Chronique Scandaleuse</i>. And as
excuse it is always said, with complete justice:
'The men there have nothing but the public-houses
to go to, they ruin morals; if they had
the society which their brother officers enjoy
in the large towns these things would not happen.'
We should simply die if we couldn't go to these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
little entertainments, and now you want to
deprive us of them."</p>

<p>"I was not meaning that, I only want to
alter them, to make them simpler, to reorganise
the whole thing. To-day, when two lieutenants
meet on duty in the morning, and one tells the
other that yesterday he dined with such and
such a man of wealth, the other asks, with deadly
seriousness: 'Does he give one decent things
to eat?' Then the first speaker, who is otherwise
very proud of the fact that, owing to mental
stupidity, he cannot learn anything by heart,
rattles off the long <i>menu</i>, together with the
names of the various wines! If an old staff-officer
who knows how to judge good wine did
this I should not object&mdash;the man has a right,
I might almost say a sacred duty, to recognise
with gratitude what the Almighty allows him
to have in the shape of excellent wine&mdash;but
when a lieutenant of twenty does this it is nothing
but a vice to boast of. When people are young
they ought not to think about what is put before
them, they ought not indeed to know anything
about it, but they are unfortunately being
educated into <i>gourmands</i> and <i>gourmets</i>. Whenever
a lieutenant is invited to dinner the lady
of the house wrings her hands and says: 'We
must not give this and that, it's not good enough;
and if we don't give these fine gentlemen good
things to eat they won't come here again, they
are so dreadfully spoiled nowadays.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is, as you know, the universal custom
to invite captains or staff-officers to dinner,
lieutenants only to balls, but is the supper after
a ball anything else but a dinner served later in
the evening? There are caviare, lobster salads,
pasties of goose-liver&mdash;I know the whole list&mdash;and
one bottle of champagne follows the other,
and that is the folly. No, not the folly, but the
wickedness which Society commits against the
young officers; you are so terribly spoiled that
you become firmly convinced that a luxurious
life is the only life; you see it everywhere, in
every house you go into, and it is, therefore, not
to be wondered at if you get false ideas."</p>

<p>"But how do you propose to alter Society?"</p>

<p>"In this way: In future it should not be
simply a question of eating and drinking; the
lieutenants should really have society; not only
a huge supper. But, above all, in future the
young lieutenant must be treated as a human
being, not as a little god. He must understand
that people do not stand on tremendous ceremony
with him and involve themselves in expense on
his behalf; he must be made to feel that he is
nothing but a young man of good family.</p>

<p>"People must not overwhelm him with flattery;
he must, of course, be treated politely and
cordially as any other guest would be, but he
must not always take the first place. When
Society makes up its mind to do this then the
lieutenant will become once more what he ought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
to be, but what, alas! he no longer is. His
foolish self-complacency will vanish, he will
again perform his duties with enthusiasm and
delight; again will he live simply and economically,
and he will then be no longer ashamed
to confess, openly and honourably: 'My means
do not allow me to do such and such a thing.'
He will no longer run up debts, nor gamble,
and the number of men who are ruined by their
profligate lives will be speedily decreased. And
when later he drops the uniform he will not
long for the flesh-pots of Egypt as the present
generation do; he will know how to live on his
income, and then if, during his years of active
service he were not worshipped as a second
golden calf, he could endure to play an unimportant
part when he retires on a pension. And
the one thing more: If when he is an officer
he understands clearly that he is not superior to
other people, then when he takes his discharge
he will not be ashamed and afraid of working,
nor of adding to his somewhat limited stock
of knowledge in order to get some appointment
or other which will enable him to support himself
and his family. He will consider it more honourable
to live on money which he had honestly
earned than on credit, or by running into debt."</p>

<p>Fritz looked at his father in great astonishment.
"But what makes you take these views?"</p>

<p>"Why do I take them? I have always had
them, though perhaps I have not always lived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
in accordance with them. You know what a
situation I am in, and naturally enough I often
ask myself who is to blame for it. I have thought
long and much on the subject, and I have come
to the conclusion: it is Society that spoils us
utterly as it is now spoiling you, and then casts
us aside as valueless directly we no longer wear
the dazzling uniform. Society means well, but
without wishing to do so it commits more sins
against the lieutenants than it can answer for,
and from this point of view His Majesty was
perfectly right when he made the remark I have
already referred to: 'The best society for the
officer is the society of the officer.' I know this,
that if ever I had been the colonel and commander
of a regiment I should have said to my
officers: 'Gentlemen, you must give up going all
over the place wherever a smoking dish awaits
you; I will give you a list of the families where
you can visit.' I should have only chosen those
where my officers could have had, first of all,
nice, pleasant, friendly, social intercourse, and,
secondly, quite simple suppers. Of course, as
you can imagine, my son, the officers would
have at first cursed and sworn, but later they
would have been grateful to me. Bismarck
used to say: 'Other nations can imitate everything
we possess except the Prussian lieutenant.'
The old statesman was right when he spoke.
Would he be equally right to-day, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"But, father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't interrupt, my boy," laughed the old
major; "you are my dearly-loved son, and my
joy, but would you maintain that you are the
model Prussian lieutenant whom Bismarck
praised?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, not exactly that," admitted Fritz,
yielding, "but still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now be a good fellow, don't defend yourself
any further. It's high time, moreover, for us
to stop talking. I must have my afternoon nap.
At six o'clock I am going to the club. Will you
come with me?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Dad."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, good-bye for the present,"
and the old man went into his room.</p>

<p>It was not till supper that the family were
all together again, and the men folk were late
in coming. They had stayed longer than usual
at the club, the members of which were retired
officers who day after day argued and disputed
concerning their dismissal and the advancement
of their comrades who, according to their firm
conviction, ought to have been retired far earlier
than they. Fritz's appearance aroused quite a
sensation in the little circle; they were delighted
to see at lunch once again a lieutenant on active
service, even though he was in mufti, and they
were suddenly of the opinion that the ordinary
sour Moselle was not at all a suitable beverage for
the occasion. They ordered a better brand and
chatted gaily over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>The major and his son were somewhat silent
at supper; the mother told all about the visits
she had paid with Hildegarde, and as her husband
was in an amiable frame of mind she thought
this would be a favourable moment for him to
bear the disappointment of learning that the
Warnows had only sent him six thousand
marks. So she told him about it, and also that
she had changed the cheque in the bank.</p>

<p>"Well, it's not much, certainly, but it's something,"
averred the major. "Let me have the
money."</p>

<p>His wife objected. "Let me keep it till to-morrow,
then we will talk over things quietly
and consider whom we must pay."</p>

<p>"Paying is all very well," said Fritz, "but
surely you wouldn't be so stupid, now that you
have a few pence in your pockets, to fling them
away again. If you pay one person all the others
will come running to the house to-morrow, in
honour of the Dad's birthday. Whoever would
be so stupid as to pay debts?"</p>

<p>His father quite agreed with him. "Fritz is
right, Fritz is a sensible fellow. The crew have
waited all this time for their money and can
certainly wait a few weeks longer until Hilda is
engaged. To your health, Hilda!"</p>

<p>Fritz also raised his glass. "Long life to
your future husband! By the way what's his
name? Not that it matters; the thing is, he
has money."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>But Hildegarde did not lift her glass, she
would like to have got up from the table, she
could not bear the way they talked about her,
and she could hardly refrain from bursting into
tears. What would George think if he knew
how they drank his health and how they only
thought of his money and not of himself?</p>

<p>"Well, if you won't drink with us, leave it
alone," said Fritz, and emptied his glass.</p>

<p>The major returned to the subject of the
money. "My dear, with that money we might
really have a nice little holiday; for three years
we have not stirred from this miserable hole.
We would leave two thousand marks at home,
so that when we returned we were not penniless,
and the rest we would take with us and go for a
few weeks to Italy."</p>

<p>The idea was very agreeable to his wife, but
she said, however, "Later, perhaps, when Hilda
is engaged. Remember the engagement may
take place any day, and we must be here to
receive the dear man with open arms."</p>

<p>"We will do that, certainly," said the major,
"we'll embrace him. He will be astonished
how affectionately we hold him, won't he, Fritz?"
And turning to his wife he went on: "Just
imagine, mother, that rogue Fritz is forty thousand
marks in debt." And he burst out laughing at
his son.</p>

<p>His mother clasped her hands, horrified. "But
Fritz, how is that possible?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>And, Hildegarde, astounded, burst out: "What
on earth do you do with the money from home
that uncle sends you?"</p>

<p>"'Ask the stars that all things know,'" Fritz
began to hum, but he could not recollect the
tune, so he only hummed a couple of inarticulate
notes.</p>

<p>It was long before his mother recovered her
composure. "It is really frightful; it is to be
hoped that Hildegarde's <i>fianc√©</i> will pay your
debts also later. But supposing he doesn't,
what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Shoot myself. But he'll soon pay up, I'll
see to that all right."</p>

<p>"If you only had been something else but an
officer," lamented his mother; "it's madness
for a man who has no money to enter the army."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," said Fritz; "but
what's the use of lamenting? It's too late now,
you should have thought of that before, when
you sent me to the Military College. I wasn't
asked."</p>

<p>"You are quite right. The rascal is reproaching
us now," laughed his father.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that at all, father. I have a
very good time as a lieutenant; besides, I don't
know what else I could have been. But you
know, being a lieutenant has its drawbacks;
one is never free from money difficulties, and
then there is the constant fear of getting one's
discharge much earlier than one expects. It's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
a horrible feeling. I really can't understand
why fathers let their sons go into the army, and
least of all can I understand why retired officers
always do it. The old officers, you, father,
most of all, and those whom I met to-day at the
club, are always complaining of the injustice of
being pensioned off so early; they lament that
the army is no longer what it once was; they
groan over their tiny pensions and their bodily
ills, the results of long years of campaigning;
they swear at the allowance they are obliged to
make their sons. They know perfectly well,
however, that he cannot manage on it, and that
he, therefore, contracts debts; they know that,
at best, their son will only be a staff-officer,
and that then till his death he will lead the same
miserable, embittered life as they have. And
alas: they also know how a mistake on duty,
a mis-spent evening, an impulsive blow may
ruin a young soldier, and although they know
all this they let him become a soldier. And
when one day the young officer is at the end of
his tether and has to leave the army, then there
is lamentation and grieving, and, of course, no
one is to blame but the son."</p>

<p>"Everybody wouldn't find things as bad as
you do," interposed the major.</p>

<p>"You are right, but I am not speaking about
myself, but of things in general. In my regiment
it happens we are nearly all the sons of retired
officers and I am constantly hearing one or other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
of them complaining: 'Why on earth didn't my
father let me be something else, as he must know
I can't possibly manage on the small allowance
he gives me?' Why do these old officers always
send their sons to a military college in spite of all
there is against it? Because it is cheap, and
it is so very convenient to get the young rascals
educated in that way. Do you suppose that in
the future the retired officers would take it quite
so much as a matter of course that their sons
should go into the army if they had to pay four
or five hundred marks a year at college instead
of eighty, besides providing them with clothes?
They would not think any more about it. But
now it's a simple matter: 'Let the boy be
educated cheaply, that's the thing, we can attend
to other things later on.' Privately they always
reckon upon an old uncle or aunt, and when
one day they 'strike' or die, then the lieutenant
is in a fix and gets into debt, or he is expected to
live upon air. People always talk about the
foolish lieutenants, but what about the foolish
parents who, to save themselves the expense
of educating them, let them adopt a profession
in which it is impossible to earn any money and
the temptation to spend it is tremendous."</p>

<p>"Very well delivered," said his father; "but
if the officer has no money to get his son properly
educated, as was the case with me, what is he to
become?"</p>

<p>"Fritz ought to have been put into business,"<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
declared Hildegarde. "If a man has no means
he should choose a career in which he can make
money."</p>

<p>"In theory that is very beautiful and quite
true," answered Fritz; "and if many fathers
were as wise as you, my charming sister, it would
be better for our officers. These first-class men,
as father called them a little while ago, would
not run around and beg and borrow and get
credit, and try their luck at cards in order to
try and keep their heads above water until they
find a rich wife or are ruined."</p>

<p>The major had listened to his son very attentively,
now he said: "I am astonished that you,
an officer's son, should talk in this way. Who,
according to your theory, should supply the
army with officers if not we?"</p>

<p>"First of all, only those parents who have the
financial means to provide for their sons' future;
and then no one ought to be made an officer
unless he has real enthusiasm and love for his
profession and is willing, if need be, to make
sacrifices and bear deprivations for its sake.
But you cannot expect that a kid who is sent to
a college at eight should know if he has any real
liking for the work of a soldier. He ought not
to choose a profession until he is able to judge
for himself to a certain extent; a father ought
not to send his son into the army from motives
of economy, or God knows what other reasons,
and then demand of him that he should be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
model of steadiness and conscientiousness. I
know that if I had anything to say in the matter
I should abolish the Cadet Colleges."</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" burst out the major, "you are
becoming worse and worse."</p>

<p>"It will have to be," continued Fritz. "You
yourself pointed out to me a little while ago that
we do not learn nearly enough at college, but
quite apart from that there is another drawback;
we go into the army too young, we are made
officers in two years. Lieutenants of eighteen
and nineteen are by no means rare, and we are
suddenly given a position which no one else
enjoys at that age. We get the control of money
too early without ever having learnt how to
manage it. Just think of the life at a military
college, how we are watched and protected!
One dare not smoke or drink beer or go out
without being invited. One has to say how
long one stayed with one's relatives&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But that is all very right," interposed
Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"It may be, but it may not be: the transition
to the other kind of life is too sudden, too
quick. Twenty-four hours after one has left
this college one is an ensign, and then all at
once he enjoys that complete liberty against
which he was so zealously guarded but a short time
ago. One can eat and drink what one likes, one
can go where one will, in short, one can enjoy all
the pleasures of life at one go off. And so one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
easily oversteps the limits and does all sorts of
stupid things in the joy of having escaped such
strict surveillance. And who can blame an
ensign for this? The young ensign gets accustomed
to leading an idle life, and this continues
when he becomes a lieutenant, only very few
having the energy to alter. We were lately
looking over the Army List to see how many
of our contemporaries at college were still in
the army, and we were simply astonished to
find how many had vanished. The education
at the Cadets' College is answerable for this&mdash;that
alone. At nineteen a man is an officer, at three-and-twenty
he gets his discharge; that happens
more often than people believe, and that shows
clearly that the cadets at college have not learnt
the one thing properly that they ought to have
learnt&mdash;to control themselves and to live as
officers in a suitable manner. At college far too
much stress is laid upon drill, exercise, lessons
and other things, and not nearly enough on the
education of the youthful mind. There is no
education of the individual, of the character;
it's all done <i>en bloc</i>, and the college can never
take the place of the home; what the child
sees and hears and learns unconsciously
there, is worth a thousand times more than
what is so stringently imparted to him at
college."</p>

<p>"But how can it be altered?" asked the
major, who was deeply interested in the conver<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>sation.
The ladies, meanwhile, had risen from
the table and taken their needlework.</p>

<p>"I do not know," acknowledged Fritz, "but
some means may be found. The Cadets' Colleges
must, as I have said, be abolished, and every
officer must have passed his matriculation, as
was formerly the case in the Marines. There
should be a limit of age; in my opinion it should
be twenty, and then a man could not be a lieutenant
till he was two-and-twenty; that is quite
early enough, if after that age was no more
taken into account. The age limit must be
abolished. To-day no one who has not reached
a certain rank by a certain age has any chance of
making a career for himself. What is the object
of keeping the army so young by all possible
means? As a result of this, every year hundreds
and hundreds of men have to seek for posts of
all kinds. New elements, new officials, new
views are introduced, and this does not tend to
facilitate the training of the troops. If a man
is lieutenant at twenty-two he can be a captain
at five-and-thirty, a major at forty-four, and a
colonel at eight-and-forty. Surely that is young
enough, isn't it? And if he distinguishes himself
in any way he can get his promotion earlier."</p>

<p>"And would that make for efficiency in time
of war?"</p>

<p>"You can answer that better than I can.
You were pensioned as a complete invalid, but
in spite of this were you not at your discharge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
quite young enough and active enough to have
done duty on the field?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and no," grumbled the major. "I
will explain what I mean. The chief army
doctor worried round me for a long time, but
he could find no wound for which he could write
a certificate, so I assisted him a little and mentioned
injuries which I did not possess, and then
it was all right. But I could easily have held
out for five&mdash;no, ten years. Go into a pension
office in any large town and look at the innumerable
officers who go there regularly at the first
of each month to draw their pension&mdash;a few
miserable pounds. They are all 'complete
invalids,' or who have been pensioned on account
of their age. Yet health and energy are to be
read in their faces."</p>

<p>"That is just what we all say," put in Fritz.
"We have been lately talking about these things
in the Casino; nothing of much value is said,
still it is interesting what the different officers
think about these matters. We are unanimous
in wanting to abolish the military college. Every
lieutenant must have passed his matriculation
and no one can be an officer before he is one-and-twenty;
if we once have that, there will be
a great alteration in the army."</p>

<p>There was a long pause; the major was ruminating
over what Fritz had just said, then he said:
"In many ways you have really most sensible
ideas."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is what I think," Hildegarde chimed
in; "I must compliment you, Fritz. When
I hear you speak so seriously, and with so much
knowledge, I can hardly recognise you as my
gay and frivolous brother."</p>

<p>Fritz bowed to his sister. "Very much
obliged. Yes, I have at intervals my lucid
moments, they tell me that in the regiment;
but, alas! these mental illuminations are but
rare. My mental darkness only disappears when
I have drunk a good deal of wine; then I begin
to think. I haven't courage at other times.
From such occasions I recognise that I am a
social democrat."</p>

<p>"But, Fritz&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, that <i>is</i> good! You a lieutenant and
a social democrat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Calm yourselves," implored Fritz. "I have
not sworn brotherhood with Bebel. When I
say I am a social democrat I don't, of course,
mean that I have subscribed to the programme
of that party, though I must say the division
of property would suit me well, provided I got
a good thing out of it! I only meant to say
that I am a dissatisfied aristocrat, and so are we
all, from the colonel down to the youngest lieutenant.
One can't say as much as one would
like to, because naturally one has to remember
the uniform one wears, but soon there will be
complaints enough, I can assure you, not only
in our regiment but in all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was certainly not like that in my time,"
lamented the major; "discussions we had often,
of course, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Formerly things were very different, father.
Formerly everybody got his majority, now one
may remain a first lieutenant for ever and be
transferred to a district command or some such
thing. Formerly it really was a day of honour
and rejoicing when there was an inspection by
those high in authority, but what happens
now? Everybody trembles for weeks before
it takes place, and for weeks afterwards, in the
fear that someone may get his discharge as a
result of it. There used to be a three-years'
service, now the men have to get through the
same amount of work and drill in two years, and
the military and extra-military duties of to-day
are not to be compared with those of ten years
ago. Ah, and the money question! I am not
thinking of myself, I am an extravagant dog,
but now and again someone attempts to live
on his allowance and the authorities do all they
can to put obstacles in his way. Now it's a
festival, now a guests' day, a birthday celebration,
a garden entertainment and ladies invited,
the jubilee of the regiment, a farewell dinner;
even if a man wants to be steady and economical
he can't get out of the champagne&mdash;he simply
must drink with the others. Whether in former
times you used so much of your pay for presents,
flowers, Casino subscriptions, and a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
and one other things, that I don't know. And
then, the expense of one's clothes; why, I believe
I owe my tailor alone five thousand marks.
There's always some new fashion or other; new
cloaks, different caps, coats, new buttons, new
scarves, and all the rest of it. And who has to
pay for all this? Why, the officer, of course.
And where does he get his money from? Of
course that's his own business. On the one hand
we are warned to be steady and not fling away
our money, and on the other we are always
being dragged into fresh expenses. It will all
have to be altered, or in ten years' time our
officers will be ten times more heavily in debt
than even to-day. You, father, to-day were
blaming Society because we lived beyond our
means, but we officers blame the authorities.
There must always be money for regimental
purposes, but nobody troubles how we live, and
then when we get into debt there's a devil of a
row and we are bound to pay up within three
days. On such occasions we are threatened
with dismissal, of which the colonel also runs
the risk because he was not strict enough in preventing
us from getting into debt. That is what
happened to me lately. I owed the Casino four
hundred marks, and had to face the alternative
of paying within four-and-twenty hours or
undergoing five days' arrest; naturally I paid,
and the colonel was satisfied. It didn't occur
to him to ask where I had got the money from."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"And where did you get it from?"</p>

<p>"Borrowed it from the Jews, of course. I
am not a magician and cannot get money from
the air. It's so ridiculous. One is forced to
contract new debts in order to pay off the old
ones which comes to the colonel's ears."</p>

<p>"Does your colonel know that you have
debts?"</p>

<p>"Of course he knows, though, probably, he
does not guess how deeply I am involved. He
says to himself, 'What I do not know does not
concern me. I need not trouble about things
which are not officially brought to my notice.'
His own future and his career are of far more
importance to him than mine. He doesn't
really care if I go to the devil or not; but if I
do go he may go also; so he not only shuts
both eyes, but also both ears. He doesn't want
to see or hear anything, for, of course, he knows
perfectly well that I am not the only one. If he
takes action against one, he would have to
against the others, and he doesn't want to do
that. He wants to become a general; his successor
can see about the officers who are in debt."</p>

<p>It was late when they went to bed. The
father and son would have preferred to go on
talking all through the night, but the women folk
urged an adjournment; they must remember
to-morrow was the day of the festivity which
would bring in its train a great deal of exertion,
visits, and congratulations of all kinds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>But, alas! the day of rejoicing was not such
as had been expected. It got about that Hildegarde
had changed a cheque in her father's name,
and the news spread like lightning through the
little town. Everybody who knew of this and
had any claim on the major determined to go
early in the morning, if possible, so as to be the
first, and ask him to pay his account which had
been owing for ages.</p>

<p>They were taking their early cup of coffee
when the tradesmen were announced. The major
knew what was before him and cursed and swore
like mad.</p>

<p>"That's what happens when you women
interfere in money matters. How could you be
so stupid as to change a cheque, even if only
one person was standing by and saw you? And
why was it a cheque at all? Can't the Warnows
pay the miserable few thousands (hundreds) in
cash? Nobody would then have heard of it;
but now I am obliged to pay out some of the
money. But," he roared out suddenly, "I won't
do it at all. I did not think to have my sixtieth
birthday spoilt by that shameless crew. I'll see
them all to the devil first."</p>

<p>"Shall I go and talk to these people?"
asked Fritz. "I have great experience in these
things, and I can safely say that no one has
ever got anything from me. I can't understand,
father, why you get so excited over such trifles.
Now, let me go and try what I can do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>He was about to go out of the room, but his
mother kept him back.</p>

<p>"That won't do, Fritz. You don't know
how often the bailiff from the court has been here.
Things have gone so far&mdash;I mean&mdash;well, you
will have to know it&mdash;up till now he has only
sealed some of our furniture and has not sold
any; but if the authorities hear that we really
have money he will have to sell us up. He
told us that, and we wanted to spare papa that
to-day."</p>

<p>"Above all things, certainly." Fritz had
become serious, and involuntarily he looked
round to see the seals.</p>

<p>"He has only put on seals where they could
not be seen," the mother whispered to her son;
"on the carpets, the piano, the bookshelf, the
pictures&mdash;briefly, all the things that stand against
the walls. Oh, it's frightful!" and she began
to cry.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right, cry!" roared the major.
"Formerly on one's birthday one was serenaded;
now, when one is old and grey, one's wife weeps
because there is no money and the creditors are
outside the door. A man must live to be sixty
to enjoy such an honour."</p>

<p>He stamped to and fro cursing, listening
from time to time to the people who were in
the vestibule waiting for him. Suddenly he
stood in front of Hildegarde and put his hand
on her shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eh, Hilda, you see we cannot wait much
longer for your lover. Bring him soon, before
it is too late, before that rascally crew has taken
everything and sold us up and I and your mother
are cast into the street."</p>

<p>His words expressed such bitterness and such
despair that Hildegarde forgot all about her
own feelings and how she was looked upon as
deliverer, and in grief for her parents she burst
into tears.</p>

<p>"Number two," scolded the major. "That's
right."</p>

<p>"Don't be unjust, father. You can't blame
mother and Hildegarde for being sad. The
affair is more than unpleasant to me even."</p>

<p>"Then you had better begin and cry," cursed
the old man, whose veins stood out on his forehead.</p>

<p>"I am not thinking of myself but how these
people can be satisfied in some way or other. I
did not know that any of the furniture was sealed.
You ought to have told me so." After a slight
pause he asked, "How much is it for?"</p>

<p>"Only two thousand marks."</p>

<p>"This must be paid first of all, and this very
day."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think so. The seals have been
all right there for a long time."</p>

<p>"In spite of that the two thousand marks
must be paid," continued Fritz with determination
and energy, "and if you cannot pay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
it I must. I lately won a few thousands at
cards, and I will give you a couple."</p>

<p>The major stared at his son. "And what is
the reason of this generosity, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Consideration for myself and Hildegarde.
If it were conceivable that it should ever be
known in my regiment how matters stood with
you here, I should not only lose my position,
but also my credit, and that might have consequences
which would not be pleasant for either
of us. And one must consider Hildegarde.
Just imagine if in the next few weeks, or perhaps
in the next few days, Hilda's prospective lover
were to pay you a visit and by some unfortunate
chance caught sight of the seals. The fellow
would have to be a downright idiot if this did
not open his eyes to the fact that he was only
being married for his money. And this knowledge
must not come before the marriage, it
must be prevented at all cost. If you can't
do this I must."</p>

<p>The major had sunk into a chair and was
gazing gloomily in front of him, the two ladies
were softly crying.</p>

<p>Fritz got up and went to his mother. "I
will go and talk to these people. Will you give
me the six thousand marks, it can't be helped."</p>

<p>"The dear money!" The major groaned;
for the first time for many a day he had been
able to sleep the whole night through without
being awakened by anxious thoughts. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
consciousness of having six thousand marks in the
house in cash had filled him with great joy and
given him a feeling of tranquillity and security.
And now the people stood outside who were to
take his money from him.</p>

<p>"Fritz," he said, turning to his son, "you
promise me to do the best you can with these
people. Don't pay it all away or we shall not
have any money in the house."</p>

<p>"I can manage with the housekeeping till
the first," the mother said; "I have still a
hundred marks."</p>

<p>"And I can give you another hundred,
mamma," put in Hildegarde. "Aunt gave me
more than I needed for travelling expenses."</p>

<p>"And I will contribute a hundred marks
also," said Fritz. He had really no feeling
for his family, but the poverty that reigned
seemed to him so horribly unsuited to their
social position he must give a helping hand,
partly indeed on his own account, so as not
to be the son of a beggar.</p>

<p>Fritz turned to the door once again. "You
are quite sure you want me to talk to these
people, father, or would you rather&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the major declined. "No, no, you go,
I should get into a temper; do what you can."</p>

<p>Fritz went into the next room and summoned
all the creditors who were standing outside.
They were all workmen or tradesmen. All knew
Fritz personally, and greeted him in a friendly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
fashion and were very deferential in their
behaviour.</p>

<p>In the regiment Fritz was regarded as excessively
haughty and proud, but when he wanted
to get anything out of a person he could be
exceedingly amiable. He shook hands now with
all, asked after the health of their families, and
now and again joked with them. He had
indeed already half won the battle when he said,
"My father, who is not feeling very well to-day,
has requested me to speak to you and to settle
your accounts so far as he is in a position to do
so. There are, indeed, rather a lot," he said
laughingly, "but we shall be able to make
an arrangement; naturally we cannot pay all
at once. You know that in consequence of the
failure of his bank my father has lost a great
deal"&mdash;then he went on with his fabrications&mdash;"but
within the next few months we shall get
a large sum of money from the family estates,
and then each of you will be paid to the uttermost
farthing. To-day we can only pay part, and I
am sure you will all agree to this. You know,
perhaps, that to-day my father is celebrating
his sixtieth birthday, and I am sure you would
not wish to spoil the day when he might be so
happy with his wife and children."</p>

<p>No, they did not want to do that; naturally
they knew the money would be quite safe, only
they had heard that yesterday the respected
major had received a large sum of money, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
they only wanted to see if they could not secure
a little of it.</p>

<p>Fritz listened to these words with joy; these
people were much more sensible, and above
all much more respectful than he had dared to
hope; mentally he put aside a thousand marks
for his parents. If he divided five thousand
marks (¬£250) among these tradespeople they
would be more than satisfied.</p>

<p>He had the bills given to him, and a joyful
smile played on his lips when he added up the
amounts; the whole lot amounted to only
ten thousand marks (¬£500). "I shall save
another thousand," he thought to himself;
then he called up each one singly, spoke to him
cheerfully and arranged things as he wanted. All
declared that they were quite satisfied to have
received a fourth of their accounts, the remainder
to be paid within three months.</p>

<p>It was a good hour before Fritz had finished;
from each he exacted a written statement that
he would not press for money during the next
few months nor send in any accounts. To keep
the people in a good humour all this time he had
given them wine and offered them cigars. They
took the wine and with Fritz drank his father's
health, but they did not venture to smoke in
the presence of the honoured lieutenant and
in the respected major's apartments.</p>

<p>At last they departed; Fritz shook hands
with them once again, and with a friendly word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
they all parted good friends. From the passage
the laughter of the departing ones penetrated
into the breakfast-room, where the others were
awaiting the result of the interview.</p>

<p>Beaming with joy, Fritz returned and laid
the two thousand marks on the table. "Well,
father, I've rescued that for you; for the present
they are all satisfied and for three months you
have a respite. Before the time is up Hilda
will long have been married, and even if she is
only engaged I'll manage to get you the few
pounds. I've done more difficult things than
that. But one thing I should like to know,
father: surely these few debts, amounting in
all to ten thousand marks, didn't deprive you
of your night's rest? I thought they would
have been at least seventy or eighty thousand."</p>

<p>"I thought so too; perhaps there are a lot
more. I never had the courage to add them
all up."</p>

<p>"Unless one can pay them there's not much
point in doing so," said Fritz, with indifference;
then, partly out of curiosity, partly from real
interest, he asked, "What other debts have
you then, father?"</p>

<p>"All over the place; the bills are turning
grey with age, and some indeed are really primeval."</p>

<p>"In that case a lot of them are no longer
valid."</p>

<p>"But Fritz," cried Hildegarde, "you surely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
wouldn't take advantage of that? The tradesmen
must have their money."</p>

<p>"Very easy to say that, but where is it to
come from?" objected the major. "I haven't
any money&mdash;at any rate, not for the moment."</p>

<p>"Have you any bills or I O U's out?" inquired
Fritz. "You must not be offended
with me for asking you this, but I have been
to a certain extent your business agent to-day.
I should like to have a clear idea of how matters
stand."</p>

<p>"No," his father assured him, "I have never
given any of these, but I am indebted to all
my friends; one for four thousand (¬£250),
another three thousand (¬£150), a third a thousand
(¬£50), and so on."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you need not grow grey because
of these; whoever lends money to a friend
knows perfectly well in nine hundred and ninety-nine
cases out of a thousand he will not get
it back again. And I really see absolutely no
reason why you should be the exception. Whoever
lent you money knew perfectly well he
would not see it again."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that is all very well," grumbled
the old major, "but the people only lent me
the money because I told them of Hildegarde's
prospective engagement."</p>

<p>"Father, really&mdash;&mdash;" cried Hildegarde. She
blushed crimson and was beside herself with
indignation. "It is not enough that you think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and talk about nothing else but my possible
engagement, but you must also tell strangers
about it in order to get credit."</p>

<p>The mother laid her hand gently on her
shoulder. "But, Hilda, you must not take it
in that way; we only spoke about it to intimate
friends."</p>

<p>The major also tried to calm her, but Hildegarde
would not be pacified. "I cannot go out
in the town any more, you have made it impossible
for me here. Now I understand the
veiled allusions of mamma's friends yesterday
when they inquired so sympathetically after my
health. I shall go away to-morrow; I will not
stay here a day longer."</p>

<p>"This is certainly a delightful birthday celebration,"
snarled the major, and he struck the
table a violent blow with his fist.</p>

<p>"Hildegarde will be all right again directly,"
said Fritz, "she's a sensible girl; naturally
these money complications have upset her. This
afternoon she will be her old self again. Now
I must go and arrange matters with the bailiff
or the champagne will not taste good."</p>

<p>But although by the afternoon the seals had
been removed from the furniture the champagne
somehow or other was not successful. A dark
shadow lay over the house, and remained there,
and when at last the major went to bed he had
to confess that he had never spent so sad a birthday
as the day when he reached the age of sixty.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
  <span class="smcap">The Wages of Sin</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Little</span> Willberg had shot himself!</p>

<p>There was sincere sorrow in the regiment
at the loss of their comrade, who had been
the universal favourite, yet, in spite of that,
they could not forgive him for not having taken
his discharge before taking his life. Twenty-four
hours sooner or later could have made no
difference to him; within that time he could
have managed it. They could not understand
why he had shown so little consideration for
the regiment he had so dearly loved and of which
he had always been so proud. The act of one
officer affects the credit of all; Willberg understood
that perfectly well, and he ought to have
remembered that his suicide would cause all
kinds of unpleasantness to the regiment.</p>

<p>This was the universal view, and how right
it was was shown by the fact that the Berlin
newspapers were full of little Willberg's death.
An attempt had been made to hush up the
affair, and at the request of the colonel, the
adjutant, Count Wettborn, had visited all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
newspaper offices and requested that nothing
might be published concerning the sad affair.
The count had been to all except the two social
democratic organs; he could not bring his mind
to visiting them; and it was just these two
newspapers that daily published fresh revelations
concerning the life of the dead man. There
came to light, indeed, more than had been
feared. The "Golden Butterflies" were beside
themselves with rage that all these things which,
in their opinion, were nobody's concern but their
own, should be published, and the worst of it
was that from the history of the dead man's
life people drew unfavourable conclusions concerning
the spirit and mode of life of the "Golden
Butterflies."</p>

<p>The "Golden Butterflies" were simply distracted;
why should this thing have happened
to them?&mdash;to them who were so proud and
distinguished, and who possessed the reputation
of being one of the most aristocratic of infantry
regiments? And why, again, should it have
been an officer belonging to the highest nobility
who gave people the opportunity of criticising
the regiment? The newspapers, of course, found
this an excellent occasion for renewing their
attacks on the aristocracy and declaring that
the people with blue blood in their veins were
not a whit better or more to be respected than
those who had to be content with miserable
red blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>But the worst of all was that what the newspapers
reported, unfortunately, approached the
truth. Willberg must have been living frightfully
extravagantly, and he was mixed up in highly
disreputable affairs. Much was revealed of which
his fellow-officers had had no idea. The colonel
went about in a state of great excitement, cursing
and swearing. On the day after the sorrowful
event there was a regular attack on the regimental
bureau by people who had claims on
Willberg, and who wanted to know who would
settle them, and when after this nobody else
was admitted to the barracks, there were showers
of letters which disclosed more or less discreditable
episodes in Willberg's life.</p>

<p>Why, oh why, should it have been an aristocrat
who drew down upon the regiment such scandal
and rebuke? Nobody said it aloud, but everybody
thought the same thing. If only it had
been Winkler instead of little Willberg who had
shot himself, how satisfied they would have been;
they could have struck an attitude and declared,
with great pride, "You see, we nobles are the
better men." But it was the aristocrat who was
dead, and the plebeian was still alive!</p>

<p>None of the "Golden Butterflies" knew what
it was that had so suddenly driven Willberg to
death, and he had not left a letter or a line behind
which gave the slightest clue to it.</p>

<p>As a matter of course the colonel inquired of
his fellow-officers whether any of them could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
give him any information, but the "Golden
Butterflies" looked at one another and shrugged
their shoulders. All of them knew of course
that little Willberg had lost money at cards, but
that had often happened, and why should he,
therefore, have shot himself on this particular
occasion rather than earlier? And this view was
strengthened by the fact that the Uhlan, when
questioned, had declared that Willberg had
paid him his gaming debts shortly before his
death. As a matter of fact this was not the
truth; on the contrary, the Uhlan had emphatically
reminded Willberg that the date for the
payment of the debt had passed, and had admonished
him that in affairs of this kind, which
were designated debts of honour, etiquette
demanded the most scrupulous punctuality. It
was after this that Willberg shot himself, and
although the Uhlan need hardly reproach himself
with having driven a comrade to death,
still he was very glad that the affair had not been
made public.</p>

<p>On the day after the burial it occurred to the
adjutant of the regiment to ask Willberg's man
if he could give any information in the matter.
But he could disclose nothing, although he was
subjected to a formal examination; at last,
however, he remembered something. "Now I
recollect, sir, one evening I took a letter to
Lieutenant Winkler, and my master waited at
home for the answer, and when it did come he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
was greatly agitated. I had never seen him
before like this. I heard him walking up and
down for hours, and next morning when I went
to call him he had not been to bed at all, but
was lying on the sofa asleep."</p>

<p>"Do you know what was in the letter you
took to Lieutenant Winkler?"</p>

<p>He could give no information on this point,
so he was dismissed, and the adjutant told the
colonel what he had just learnt. The latter
walked about in agitation.</p>

<p>"How long has Lieutenant Winkler been on
furlough?"</p>

<p>The count consulted the calendar. "He has
to announce his return to-morrow mid-day!"</p>

<p>"So much the better, otherwise I should have
had to recall him by telegraph. The authorities
ask for explicit details concerning Willberg's
death. Till now I was confronted by a riddle;
perhaps Winkler can throw some light on the
subject."</p>

<p>George had already heard of Willberg's death
while he was in Paris, and although at first the
news had shocked him he could not pretend that
he was deeply grieved. Almost hourly he had
thanked Olga for having persuaded him to take
this journey. He could not hide from himself
that in spite of the best resolutions he would not
have been able to meet Willberg calmly.</p>

<p>He had also told himself hourly that even
when he returned he did not think he could see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
him in cold blood, and thus to a certain extent
he breathed more freely when he heard of Willberg's
death, and he was almost grateful to
Heaven for having spared him a future meeting.
It was sad, of course, that Willberg had been
obliged to take his life when he was still a young
man, but as far as the army and the officers
were concerned his death was no loss. He had
dreaded meeting him again, but now he returned
to the garrison quite cheerfully. Fourteen happy
days lay behind him; Olga and he had thoroughly
enjoyed themselves in beautiful Paris; his furlough
had been a real time of refreshment, and
he was quite pleased to return to his duties and
his active life.</p>

<p>"The colonel desires that Lieutenant Winkler
will speak to him to-morrow at eleven in the
regimental bureau." For a moment George was
somewhat alarmed. Could the colonel have
found out that he had been in France, in Paris,
without permission? Well, the punishment for
that was not severe, at the worst a few day's
confinement to one's own lodgings, which would
not destroy the memory of the delightful days
he had just enjoyed.</p>

<p>The first words, however, which the colonel
addressed to him next morning showed him
that his fears were groundless. He inquired
how he had enjoyed the Riviera, and then he
came at once to the point. He told him what
Willberg's former servant had said, and begged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
George to give him any further information he
had. "Above all it is most important for me
to know what was in the letter which Willberg
sent you. Can you, and will you, give me information
concerning this?"</p>

<p>George considered for a moment, then he
said: "As I was not expressly pledged to keep
silence I do not think I shall be committing an
indiscretion if I tender an account of it."</p>

<p>"Have you still Willberg's letter?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; but I perfectly remember what it
contained. Lieutenant von Willberg wrote to
me that he had been gambling and required five
thousand marks (¬£250) to settle a debt of honour.
If he did not get the money by some means or
other he said he should have to put a bullet
through his head to vindicate his honour."</p>

<p>"This confounded gambling!" cursed the
colonel. "Who will extirpate it root and
branch?" After a slight pause he asked: "Did
you give him the money?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"The gambling debt was paid by some other
means," interposed Count Wettborn; "the
colonel therefore need not have any anxiety
about that matter."</p>

<p>The colonel breathed more freely. "Well, I
am glad of that." Then he turned to George
again: "You did not give him the money then?
Might I ask why? Do not misunderstand me;
it is, of course, your own affair whether you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
lent Willberg the money or not; but I thought
perhaps you would have given it him on this
occasion. But perhaps you did not think he
was serious in saying he would take his life?"</p>

<p>"I must confess that I did not think about
it at all. I was just about to assist Lieutenant
Willberg when I learnt something about him
that made it quite impossible for me to do so."</p>

<p>"And what was that?"</p>

<p>The colonel and Count Wettborn looked at
George expectantly.</p>

<p>"I can only answer in general terms, as I am
pledged to silence."</p>

<p>"To the dead?"</p>

<p>"No, to a living person to whom I am indebted
for my information." And after a pause
he continued: "Just as I was about to send
Lieutenant Willberg the money he asked for,
I learned quite by chance that he had behaved
to a young lady, who is intimately connected
with me, in such a manner that any Court of
Honour must have sentenced him to immediate
dismissal in case the matter became public.
From that moment I was no longer able to regard
Lieutenant Willberg as an officer and a man of
honour, and I only assist such."</p>

<p>The colonel was greatly disturbed by what
George had said. The affair was extremely
unpleasant to him, and who knew what else
might come out? He would have preferred
not to have asked any more questions, but that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
would not do, so he said: "You know that it
was your duty to inform the Court of Honour of
the dishonourable acts of a fellow-officer which
came to your ears."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I should certainly have done so in
this case if I had not been obliged to consider
the young lady, who would have been greatly
compromised if I had laid information before the
Court of Honour. I did not think I was justified
in doing this; moreover, as I had been for so
comparatively a short time in the regiment, I did
not want to be the cause of an investigation
before a Court of Honour of the conduct of a
fellow-officer who was universally loved. I asked
for leave of absence so that I might consider
calmly whether I could justify my silence to myself
and to my fellow-officers, and in my agitated
state of mind I wanted to avoid Lieutenant
Willberg. Although I have a considerable amount
of self-control there would have been a quarrel
between him and me, and a duel would have
been unavoidable&mdash;provided, of course, that the
judge of the Court of Honour considered that an
honourable man could send Lieutenant Willberg
a challenge."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Winkler!" cried the colonel,
astounded. "An officer in my regiment, belonging
to one of the noblest families in the land,
not fit to be challenged by a man of honour&mdash;pray
consider what you are saying."</p>

<p>"I am. Indeed, it is no pleasant matter to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
make these charges against a dead man who can
no longer defend himself."</p>

<p>"Then why do you do so?"</p>

<p>"To show you that, as an honourable man,
I could not have acted otherwise in refusing to
give Willberg the money."</p>

<p>The words sounded so calm, so determined,
yet so honourable and straightforward, that
the colonel rose and shook hands with George.
"I not only believe what you say, but I am
absolutely convinced of it. So far as I can
judge, you appear to have acted perfectly rightly,
and I thank you for not having given information
at once to the Court of Honour without having
first considered the whole question calmly and
quietly. It is never pleasant to hold an investigation
on a fellow-officer, especially when, as in
this case, a good deal of dirt would have been
thrown about."</p>

<p>"Much more," George asserted, "than anyone
would have believed possible."</p>

<p>"We will let the matter rest, then," the
colonel decided. "Willberg has discharged his
debts with his life, you are pledged to silence,
so let the secret remain with us."</p>

<p>After a few more questions George was dismissed,
and the colonel addressed the adjutant:
"Eh, what do you say, my dear count?"</p>

<p>Count Wettborn went on polishing his eyeglass,
then he gave forth his opinion. "I cannot
help saying it, my dear colonel, but in my opinion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Winkler has behaved splendidly in the whole
affair."</p>

<p>"That is exactly my opinion also, but it is a
great piece of luck that he is pledged not to speak;
the less said about the dead man the better for
everybody. I can imagine how everybody in
the brigade and squadron is asking how it is
possible for Willberg to lead such a life without
my knowing anything about it. Mark my
words, count: if the details of this story were
known it might cost us our posts, for you as well
as I would be blamed&mdash;I, because I was not
sufficiently acquainted with what was going on
among the officers generally and with Willberg
in particular. But it is quite impossible for me
to concern myself about each individual officer
and to notice whether he is living beyond his
means or not. That is your work, my dear
count; you ought to warn the younger officers
when they are so extravagant and wild, and
if your words are of no avail, then you ought
to inform me, so that I could take steps against
the gentlemen concerned."</p>

<p>The colonel was seriously agitated, he really
feared he might be dismissed. While the newspapers
were publishing striking articles concerning
Lieutenant Willberg he was summoned to
an audience with His Majesty, and His Majesty
had shown himself so ungraciously disposed
that the colonel had had a very bad quarter-of-an-hour.
In clear, plain language His Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
had said: "I must make the colonels of my
regiments answerable for what happens among
the officers, and when such things take place
as those that have just come to light, it is not
only a dishonour for the regiment on which I have
bestowed my special favour and patronage, but
for the whole army."</p>

<p>The colonel could only offer as an excuse the
fact that little Willberg had not only been able
to deceive him but also all his fellow-officers, and
this had somewhat modified His Majesty's anger.
"But all the same it is a great scandal." The
colonel was dismissed from his presence without
a gracious word, and he trembled for his career,
but the adjutant was able to console him. If the
colonel was to have received his discharge he would
have had it already, and now that the colonel
had seen His Majesty it was a matter of perfect
indifference what the brigades and divisions were
saying. Nothing would now happen to either the
colonel or himself; indeed, he could not have
been made personally responsible for what had
occurred. Still, he was very glad that George
was pledged to silence. For otherwise many
more things connected with the gambling might
have come to light. It might, indeed, have cost
him his post, that he, in the character of the
adjutant of the regiment, had not merely permitted
gambling in the Casino, but had to a
certain extent participated in it. He was therefore
greatly relieved that the affair had blown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
over so easily, and he made up his mind on the
next suitable occasion to put in a good word for
George and to say to the officers, "Boys, Winkler's
behaviour has been blameless; I do not, of
course, wish to influence you in any way, but I
ask you to consider whether in future you will
not be on more friendly terms with him."</p>

<p>When next day, however, the count delivered
his carefully-thought-out address to the officers
he evoked no reciprocal feeling. Every one of
them would have done what Winkler did&mdash;why
then was there anything special in it? And
as he could not say what he knew touching
Willberg's honour one really could not judge
whether the thing was so bad, and to bring
charges against a man without giving proof
was really not exactly the proper thing to do.
Either he should have said all or nothing.</p>

<p>The officers continued talking in this way,
and the count heard their criticisms with surprise
and annoyance. At last he said very
seriously: "Gentlemen, I can only repeat that,
in the opinion of the colonel, and also in my
own, Lieutenant Winkler has acted perfectly
rightly. If you think that you have the slightest
ground for complaint against him I can only
assure you you are wrong, and I advise you most
earnestly not to express to Winkler the views
you have just uttered. There might be results
that would not be agreeable to you. I beg you
to pay attention to what I have said."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>The officers certainly did this, but the count's
words did not help to alter their feeling against
George. At first his presence had been merely
inconvenient to them, now they began to hate
him. It was more than disagreeable to them
that it should be George, an "outsider," whom
they had tried to keep at arm's length, who
knew more of Willberg's life than they themselves
did, who was aware of things touching the
dead man's honour which the colonel asserted
it would not be wise to publish. In their opinion
he ought to have spoken to them in confidence;
they would have been able to judge whether what
Willberg had done was really so bad, and they
would indeed have judged justly, though at the
same time without harshness, as it concerned a
man of their own class. Whatever had made
the count talk in that way? In other words
he had said: "You have all reason to thank
Lieutenant Winkler, who went on furlough to
avoid a meeting, and in consequence a duel with
Lieutenant Willberg." That was good indeed.
They, the aristocrats, were bound to thank the
one and only <i>bourgeois</i> officer in the regiment.
The thought alone maddened them. And, besides,
who knew that George was really animated
by such noble motives as he asserted when he
took a holiday. Perhaps he had simply said to
himself: "If I see him there will be a duel";
and so he had gone for a holiday, feeling assured
that he would never meet Willberg again alive.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
He had avoided the duel merely from cowardice;
he had "funked," and should such an officer be
allowed to remain in the regiment?</p>

<p>The more the officers talked over the matter
the more enraged and angry they became, and
the wine which on such occasions was freely
passed round, increased their excitement.</p>

<p>"We must send a deputation to the colonel
and inform him that we decline to remain any
longer in the same corps with Winkler. Either
he or we!" cried out a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>But the sensible ones among them counselled
discretion; things were not so bad as that.
Everybody knew that His Majesty protected
him, and if he heard what was the feeling about
Winkler, and how they had determined not to
remain in the same regiment with him, His
Majesty would be seriously angry, especially as
recently His Majesty had not been so well disposed
towards the regiment as in former days.
They must first of all let the grass grow on Willberg's
grave; after that they could deal with
George. For the present there was nothing
further to be done than to show him still more
clearly than ever that he was not welcome among
the officers; perhaps he himself would see about
getting his exchange, and if he, a <i>bourgeois</i>, was
not delicate-minded enough to see this, it would
have to be conveyed to him by some means.</p>

<p>George soon noticed the feeling that existed
towards him; they all treated him with icy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
politeness, only spoke to him when it was absolutely
unavoidable, and answered his questions
as shortly as possible.</p>

<p>For a fortnight George endured this treatment,
then he went to the adjutant of the regiment,
the only one who during the whole time
had treated him as a friend and a comrade.</p>

<p>"I knew that you would come to me," said
the count. "I have done all in my power to
remove the ill-feeling which exists against you
among the officers. I have spoken on your
behalf, and have warned them not to drive you
to extremes, but, unfortunately, without success.
There is no need to tell you that most of them
blame you for your behaviour in the Willberg
affair; they knew that he asked you for money,
and they blame you for not having given it him.
They think that if you had done so, Willberg
would not have taken his life. Whether your
money would really have saved him&mdash;his gambling
debts were paid it must be remembered&mdash;or
whether there were other things that forced him
to take his life, only Willberg himself could say,
and his mouth is closed for ever. I have endeavoured
to make this clear to the officers, but
in this likewise I have been unsuccessful. Besides,
they appear to have all sorts of other
things against you."</p>

<p>George sat opposite the adjutant pale as death.
"So that's it. I always thought so, but I did not
expect quite such heavy charges. What can I do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have already spoken to the colonel. The
best thing would be for you to demand an official
inquiry before the Court of Honour for yourself,
but there is&mdash;I was almost going to say 'alas!'&mdash;not
the slightest ground for this. Perhaps the
feeling against you would alter if you could
inform the colonel and myself what you heard
at the last moment about Willberg, what prevented
you from helping him, and what ground
you had for bringing such heavy charges against
him. Cannot you tell me? If you like I will
preserve absolute silence, though of course it
would be best if everyone knew about it."</p>

<p>"I had permission to inform you of what I
learnt on that day whenever I considered it
absolutely necessary. I believe that now, for
my own sake, I ought no longer to remain silent."
And then he related what Olga had confided to
him.</p>

<p>The adjutant listened with great attention,
and when George had finished he sat silent for a
long time.</p>

<p>"May I ask your opinion on the matter, sir?"</p>

<p>The count continued silent, then he jumped
up suddenly. "Ach, how beastly!" He shook
his head with disgust, and once more repeated
"How beastly!"</p>

<p>George had been conscious from the beginning
of having acted rightly, but now he breathed
more freely and said, "Then you can understand
why I did not give him the money?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>The count turned to him quickly. "Understand?
Why, it was a matter of course that
yon&mdash;&mdash;" he tried to find a name for Willberg&mdash;"what
I mean is, you could not, of course, help
him under the circumstances, and everyone
will be of the same opinion. I sympathise with
you and the young lady; it would be extremely
painful for you if the story were known, but
there would be no need to give any name."</p>

<p>"I am not sure that I have the right to ask
you to inform the colonel of what I have just
told you, but I will be responsible for that.
Perhaps he will speak to the officers and tell
them that he knows everything and approves
of my conduct. Perhaps that will have the
desired result."</p>

<p>"It must; I will ask the colonel to talk
seriously to the officers, and if they will not
listen to reason of their own free will they must
be forced to hear it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>The adjutant turned to go and shook hands
with George. It was the first time that the
count had offered him his hand, the first friendliness
that he had received for a long time, the
first time that anyone had spoken to him warmly
and heartily and sympathised with him. It
did not alter things, of course, but in spite of
that George felt happier and gayer than he had
been for a long time, and the feeling of having
acted rightly in the matter gave great satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Olga scarcely recognised him when she came
in that evening; she had visited him almost
daily lately, for George sat at home evening
after evening and thought and meditated on
what would happen. He had accepted no invitations,
gone nowhere; he had lived in himself,
and spent much time in writing long letters to
his parents, in which he lamented his misfortunes.
It was a necessity of his nature to express
his feelings to the people who cared for him, but
regularly as the letters were written Olga threw
them into the fire. "Your parents cannot help
or advise you," she had answered him on the
first occasion when she destroyed his letter, and
he saw that she was quite right.</p>

<p>To-day when she came she asked if he had
finished his letter, and she could hardly believe
it when he said he had not written one at all.</p>

<p>"Whatever has happened then?"</p>

<p>He told her of the conversation he had had
with the adjutant, and asked her at the end:
"Do you think people ought to know how Willberg
treated you?"</p>

<p>Olga sat thinking for a long time, then she
said: "I care for you very much, I would gladly
give you permission to speak openly, but it
would not be wise, especially on your account.
What do our relations with one another matter
to the world? Nobody expects a young lieutenant
to be a saint, but he need not publish to
the whole world the fact that he has a 'friend,'<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
and certainly no one need know what her name
is and what has happened to her. There would
be people who would blame you, and why should
you expose yourself to that?"</p>

<p>He kissed her on the forehead. "You are
right, as you always are."</p>

<p>He could not tell how it was, but suddenly
he wondered how Hildegarde would receive such
news. He had not seen her since his return, but
daily his thoughts had wandered to her, and now
he saw her picture clearly before him.</p>

<p>"George, what are you thinking about so
seriously?"</p>

<p>He roused himself from his thoughts and
found Olga standing in front of him and laughing.</p>

<p>"You have forgotten all about me, haven't
you? For at least a minute you have been
staring straight in front of you. What were
you thinking of?"</p>

<p>He did not answer her question. "Don't be
angry," he begged, "my thoughts were far
away."</p>

<p>"In beautiful Paris?"</p>

<p>He could not help laughing. "Not exactly,
but now they have returned to you once more,"
and he tenderly drew her to him.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
  <span class="smcap">The Humiliation of the "Golden Butterflies"</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">An</span> officers' meeting had been summoned, which
all the officers of the regiment had been commanded
to attend, with the single exception of
Lieutenant Winkler, and the colonel's behaviour
to his lieutenants had been by no means gentle.
In his present excited state of mind, and with
the fear of possible dismissal after all, he was
going to take good care that there should be no
further scandals among his officers, and one
would certainly be unavoidable if their behaviour
to Lieutenant Winkler was not altered. He
therefore explained to them the Willberg affairs
as far as he was justified in doing so, and assured
them that George had behaved splendidly&mdash;indeed,
many of them might take an example
from him. At first the colonel had thought of
sending a deputation of three lieutenants to
George to convey to him the expression of his
comrades' confidence and to apologise for their
unjust suspicions. He had discussed at length
with his adjutant as to whether George was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
entitled to some substantial compensation, but
the latter had not taken his view. To make
too much of the affair was to do more harm than
good. If the colonel insisted upon an official
apology great indignation would be once more
aroused; the officers' rage would burst forth
anew, and they would consider compensation
as a still further humiliation, for George was only
a <i>bourgeois</i>, and it is always very disagreeable
for an aristocrat to say to such a one, "I did
you an injustice." After much discussion the
colonel agreed to this view, and so he only delivered
a thundering philippic, ending with the
words: "I have commanded Count Wettborn
to inform me daily concerning your behaviour
to Lieutenant Winkler; if a single complaint
reaches me, if I hear that in the future any one
of you behaves in such a way as is not permissible
under any circumstances, I shall cause the
officer concerned to be sent to a frontier garrison
within three days. I swear to this."</p>

<p>This had its effect; at least, inasmuch as
in future the officers did not dare to oppose
Lieutenant Winkler openly nor to make hostile
speeches and remarks against him. Their feeling
was not altered, and they did not become more
friendly because of the colonel's discourse, but
they kept their thoughts to themselves, and
behaved towards him in a more polite fashion, if,
perhaps, a not more friendly one. It was still
very little, indeed, that George was offered in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the way of friendship, but it was yet considerably
more than he had lately dared to hope. The
present behaviour of his fellow-officers filled him
with a certain satisfaction, and being a generous-minded
man, he was almost sorry that they
had had to endure such harsh words on his
account; but in his bearing and in his intercourse
with them he betrayed neither the one
feeling nor the other. He was polite and amiable,
but at the same time independent and self-reliant,
as he had been from the beginning.
He behaved, indeed, as if he had no idea of what
had happened at the officers' meeting, and
officially he did not know, for Count Wettborn
had not thought it advisable to inform him
directly what had been said regarding him to
the others; that would have been too great a
humiliation of the aristocracy in the eyes of the
middle class. The fact that George feigned
ignorance so cleverly, that not by a single word
did he allude to their former suspicions of him,
that he bore no grudge against anyone, and
that though he had received ample satisfaction
in consequence of the colonel's severe reprimand,
he still remained modest and unassuming in his
manners and did not play the part of innocence
justified, made a certain impression on the better
sort of men among the officers.</p>

<p>Although George betrayed nothing of all this,
he noticed that very slowly there was a slight
change of feeling towards him. He only told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Olga of this, and in his letters home he merely
said that very soon he would be quite happy in
the regiment. It was, indeed, high time, for he
had been more than a year among the "Golden
Butterflies." George felt now quite a different
being. His cheerful disposition once more showed
itself, and his happy nature drove away all the
sad thoughts which had lately so filled his
mind.</p>

<p>He enjoyed his official duties much more than
formerly, and just then several things happened
that made them pleasanter than usual. His
captain had gone away for a few days, his first
lieutenant was on furlough, and as it was a very
quiet time in the regiment, George was given
the command of his company.</p>

<p>To-day the company had been shooting, and
now it was musketry inspection. George had
at first entrusted this to the sergeant-major
alone, but at the last moment he thought it was
his duty to make a personal inspection. He
came quite unexpectedly. The men were drawn
up in the corridor, and as George mounted the
steps he heard from above such a shower of
curses that he hurried on. The cry, "The lieutenant
is coming!" produced absolute silence
in a moment, and the sergeant-major hastened
towards him to salute him.</p>

<p>"But, sergeant, whatever is the matter?
You know how our captain insists upon a good
tone in the company, and I should not like there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
to be any difference in his absence. What has
happened?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir. The lieutenant knows how everything
sounds in the corridor if one speaks a little
louder than usual, and one has to do that to make
one's self understood. Perhaps it was I was a little
angry with a man whose gun was badly cleaned."</p>

<p>"Don't get angry with him, but make a note
of it and inspect the gun again."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. I will attend to your commands."</p>

<p>George was standing on one side with the
sergeant-major, and now he dismissed him.
"Go on with your inspection."</p>

<p>The sergeant-major went back to his place,
and George walked slowly along the line, examining
the men's uniforms. Suddenly he stopped
in front of a soldier.</p>

<p>"Petersen, what have you done to yourself?"</p>

<p>The man had a swollen and inflamed eye and
a great boil on his forehead which prevented him
from wearing his cap properly.</p>

<p>"You look horrible. What has happened to
you?" inquired George once more.</p>

<p>"I fell down."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"On the steps."</p>

<p>"That's what I am always saying. You
lazy fellows don't even know how to walk, and
yet you imagine you are fit for a parade march."</p>

<p>George tried to make a joke of the affair, and,
as a rule, he found that his men liked this mode<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
of treatment; but to-day his words called forth
no response. Petersen did not laugh, and the
men standing by were evidently not amused by
it. It struck George as a little odd, but still he
thought no more of it, and turned to go, when
by chance his glance fell upon Non-Commissioned
Officer von Nissew, who was standing a little
way from him by the window, and who was
looking at Petersen with such a threatening
and fiery glance that involuntarily George was
frightened for a moment.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he grasped the real meaning
of the affair. His instinct, which had made
him dislike von Nissew from the very beginning,
was not wrong then. What he had just seen
made him determine to sift the matter to the
bottom, so he now went back to the soldier and
subjected him to a cross-examination. When
did he fall? Who were there when it happened?
Had he been to the ward-room and had his
wounds dressed by the nurse? Who was in
the room when he returned? But he could get
nothing out of the man; he had fallen down,
nobody had seen it, and he had told none, because
he had not wanted to make himself ridiculous
on account of his clumsiness.</p>

<p>"What do you know about the matter, Non-Commissioned
Officer von Nissew?" said George,
turning suddenly to him. "You are responsible
for these men. Why did you not send this man
to the ward-room? The wound looks frightful."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>The non-commissioned officer continued staring
at the soldier with threatening eyes. "I know
nothing about it, sir. I only discovered the
injury just before the inspection, and then it
was too late to send him to the nurse."</p>

<p>George knew perfectly well that von Nissew
was not speaking the truth, but he did not want
to convict him of lying before the assembled men,
on the ground of discipline and subordination.</p>

<p>"Show me the place on the steps where you
fell down."</p>

<p>A clever liar would have shown George some
place or other and said, "Here, sir." But the
soldier was so little accustomed to hypocrisy
and concealment that he did not know whether
to go to the right or to the left, and George once
more took him to task. "I want to say something
to you, Petersen; you know me, and you
know that I try to act fairly towards you all,
and shut my eyes whenever I can, but if you
stand here and lie to me and make a fool of me,
I shall get very angry indeed, and I can assure
you you won't appreciate <i>that</i> side of me. Well,
now out with it. I pledge you my word you
shan't suffer for it. Where did you fall down?"</p>

<p>A struggle was going on in Petersen's mind.
At last he said: "I did not fall down at all."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;what happened then?"</p>

<p>"Non-Commissioned Officer von Nissew struck
me on the head with a frying-pan."</p>

<p>George was enraged beyond measure, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
from the first he had not for a moment doubted
that something of the kind had happened; still,
he did not want to betray his feelings towards his
subordinate, so he only said: "So that's it.
Well, that will do. Now go back into line."</p>

<p>But the private stood still in a stiff attitude
before his lieutenant and did not move. "Do
you want to say anything else?" asked George.
"You know, Petersen, you cannot lodge a complaint
against von Nissew to-day. You must
not do that till to-morrow, or you yourself will
be liable to punishment."</p>

<p>"Sir, if you will allow me, I do not want to
make any complaint."</p>

<p>"What do you want, then?"</p>

<p>The soldier, a tall, strong, fine-looking man,
trembled in every limb.</p>

<p>"Now, out with it. You can trust me. What
is it?"</p>

<p>"Might I venture to ask you most humbly not
to tell the non-commissioned officer that I have
informed you of the truth in his matter, for then
he would thrash me again and make my comrades
belabour me with their heavy whips."</p>

<p>George involuntarily took a step back. "What
do you mean? You only imagine that. Now,
can you believe one of your superiors capable of such
a thing?" He was speaking against his own conviction,
but for the sake of discipline he was obliged
to support those in authority; an opportunity for
discovering the whole truth would come later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>Petersen was still trembling. "We know the
non-commissioned officer well enough. Last week
Meier intended to lodge a complaint because he
knocked out two of his teeth, but he heard this
and then he struck him with his riding-whip
till the blood ran, and we had to hit him also."</p>

<p>"But how could you do such a thing?"</p>

<p>"The non-commissioned officer threatened us
that he would take care that we had no leave
of absence on Sunday, and he taunted us till we
got mad with anger, and we drove Meier round
the place till he couldn't move."</p>

<p>"Well, and what then?" asked George, who
could scarcely restrain himself for indignation.</p>

<p>"Then the non-commissioned officer took out
an old Bible and made Meier swear on it that he
would not make a complaint, and then he told Meier
that if he did he would be committing perjury,
and perjury was punishable by imprisonment."</p>

<p>George was terribly angry at what he had heard,
but, in spite of this, he said, apparently quite
calmly, "Very well, that will do now, fall into rank."</p>

<p>But again Petersen did not move, and asked,
in an almost tearful tone: "Sir, will you really say
nothing of this to the non-commissioned officer?"</p>

<p>"I cannot promise that, but I pledge you my
word that von Nissew shall not ill-treat you to-night.
He will do nothing more to you. Are
you satisfied with that?"</p>

<p>Petersen shook his head. "Then the other
non-commissioned officers will, they are all in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the same box; they are not all so cruel, but they
all strike us."</p>

<p>George pretended not to hear the last words.
"You may rest content, nothing shall happen
to you to-night. I myself shall be in barracks
the whole night and will see to things. It is to
be hoped you are satisfied now."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Petersen fell into the rank, and George was
about to return to the company when he noticed
von Nissew standing a little distance off; apparently
he was waiting to speak to him, and
scarcely was George alone when the non-commissioned
officer stepped up to him hastily.</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?" asked George
curtly.</p>

<p>Nissew tried in vain to conceal his anxiety
and disquietude, and his restless eyes were
more unsteady than usual.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked George again.</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officer unsuccessfully
sought to control his voice, it trembled noticeably
as he said, "I wanted to ask you most respectfully&mdash;I
can imagine what Petersen has just said
to you&mdash;and I wanted to ask if you would be so
good as not to believe a word he says; he is the
greatest liar and slanderer in the whole company.
Our captain knows that, and gave me orders
to give special attention to Petersen, who is
secretly a social democrat. His comrades know
that. You can ask the whole company, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
all the corporals, and they will tell you the same
thing. Petersen is lying."</p>

<p>George's face expressed boundless contempt,
for every word of Petersen's showed that he
spoke the absolute truth. Whilst George had
been talking to him Nissew had certainly been
working upon his men and threatening them
with fresh ill-treatment if they did not represent
that Petersen was a liar. A feeling of inexpressible
repugnance and the greatest horror
came over George; he despised him for having
ill-treated a defenceless subordinate, but even
more for seeking to deny his guilt in this manner.
He turned to him and said, "Not only a brute,
but a coward? Ugh!"</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officer turned pale,
but he made one more effort to clear himself.
"You know, sir, what our captain thinks about
me; he has indeed informed you, sir, and when
he returns from his furlough and speaks to you,
sir, concerning me, you will see that you have
done me a bitter injustice."</p>

<p>George plainly perceived the inward significance
of these words; they reminded him of
the morning when he had been reprimanded
by his superior on account of his subordinate
officer, and he saw how delighted Nissew was
that he would be reprimanded a second time
because he had ventured to doubt so excellent
an officer as himself. The veins on his forehead
swelled, but with a great effort he controlled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
himself and said, "Non-Commissioned Officer
von Nissew, whether I am doing you an injustice
or not will be decided later, for the present I
more than suspect you of the alleged ill-treatment
of your subordinates."</p>

<p>Again von Nissew wanted to defend himself,
but the sergeant-major appeared to announce
that the muskets had all been inspected.</p>

<p>"It is fortunate that you have come, sergeant-major";
and then, turning to him, he said, in
a firm, clear voice, "Sergeant-major, take Non-Commissioned
Officer von Nissew's sword from him,
and place him under arrest, pending investigation."</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officer turned as white
as the white-washed walls and fell back.</p>

<p>"Now, sergeant-major, why don't you do
your work?" asked George, as he still hesitated
to carry out the order. "Did you not understand
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the sergeant-major, still
with hesitation; "I was only thinking, sir, what
the captain would say when he heard this."</p>

<p>With an involuntary movement George laid
his hand on his sword. "By Jove, sergeant-major,
do you or I command this company?
I demand an answer."</p>

<p>"You, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad you understand that, and
now either place the non-commissioned officer
under arrest or I shall punish you for disobedience."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>This energetic speech had its effect, and the
sergeant-major offered no further opposition.</p>

<p>"Unbuckle your sword, von Nissew."</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officer quite mechanically
unbuckled the straps and the sword fell to
the ground.</p>

<p>The sergeant-major lifted it up. "Come."</p>

<p>And without once raising his eyes, von Nissew,
with shaking knees, went down the steps with
the sergeant-major, and a little later George saw
them going over the yard together, and then
they disappeared into the guard-room, which
was in the extreme right-hand corner of the
large barracks.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, George understood
clearly what he had done, and for a moment he
was overwhelmed with doubts as to whether
perhaps he had not acted rashly and without due
consideration. Then he summoned Meier to him,
told him what Petersen had said, and asked him,
on his word of honour, if that was all true.</p>

<p>"Were you forced to swear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Were you beaten?"</p>

<p>"I can show you the marks still, sir."</p>

<p>The men must certainly have seen that the
non-commissioned officer had been placed under
arrest, otherwise Meier would not have spoken
so openly.</p>

<p>"Show them me."</p>

<p>The man pulled down his trousers and George<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
could distinctly see the marks of the bloody weals
caused by the heavy whip.</p>

<p>"That will do."</p>

<p>The man pulled up his garments again, and
in spite of the traces of the brutal ill-treatment
George could not help feeling almost pleased at
the sight of them. He had not accused von
Nissew unjustly; here were proofs of his guilt.</p>

<p>Soon after the sergeant-major returned. "The
order is carried out."</p>

<p>"Thank you; dismiss the men. I want to
speak to the non-commissioned officers alone."</p>

<p>The latter stood round their lieutenant in a
semi-circle, and George purposely made them
stand to attention so that his words might be
all the more impressive. "I want to inform
you at once that I have placed von Nissew under
arrest for gross ill-treatment of his subordinates.
As so often happens, the matter came to light
quite by chance. Had I not attended the inspection
to-day, as was originally my intention,
I should probably have never known about this,
and these disgusting brutalities, for I can call
them nothing else, would have continued. I
am informed that many other non-commissioned
officers have acted in the same way as von Nissew.
I cannot feel sure whether you knew about this
ill-treatment and failed to notify it, or whether
you also have ill-treated your men. I will not
examine into that now; it will rather be the
subject of a judicial inquiry. To-day I only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
wanted to say to you that any one of you who
does not feel absolutely free from guilt ought to
be thoroughly ashamed of himself. I am certainly
the last man to blame a non-commissioned
officer if, in a fit of anger at a soldier's stupidity
or stubbornness, he so far loses his self-control as
to give him a blow or a push. Our men quite
understand that, and they don't mind a blow
given in a state of excitement; they know it
does not mean anything, and they know perfectly
well that when they are no longer recruits they
in their turn will give a secret shove or blow
without meaning anything brutal by it. But
there is the whole difference in the world between
forgetting one's self in one's zeal for duty and
knowingly and with consideration ill-treating
anyone. The former is human, the latter simply
brutal and beastly. Condign punishment will
be administered to Non-Commissioned Officer
von Nissew and to everyone who is guilty of
such brutal behaviour. Now, I want to speak
very briefly to you about another matter. I
am told that the men are afraid of being alone
with you to-night in the barracks, because they
fear you will revenge yourselves on them for my
having placed Non-Commissioned Officer von
Nissew under arrest. It is a fine testimonial to
you that the men are afraid of you instead of
having trust in you, and you must all be very
proud of this fact." There was bitter irony in
the words. Then George continued: "I will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
rely on your honour that these fears are groundless,
but I have promised to see that no one is
ill-treated to-night. I therefore order the sergeant-major
and the sergeant to supervise the
men's rooms till bedtime and to change guard
every two hours, and all the doors are to remain
open. At nine o'clock I will take over the duty.
That is all I wanted to tell you."</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officers were dismissed.
During his speech George had studied their faces
carefully&mdash;a great many of them had turned
alternately crimson and pale, some tried to
appear as if the whole thing did not concern
them and as if they were entirely free from all
blame, but George felt that there were very few
who had an absolutely clear conscience.</p>

<p>George went with the sergeant-major into
the reading-room of the company to draw up a
report of the case and present it to the battalion.
It would then be sent to the regiment, and then,
owing to the gravity of the case, to the superior
courts. He sent off the lance-corporal, who
usually acted as clerk, and turned to the sergeant-major.
He was horrified at what he had heard
and seen, and spoke quite freely about it. "Tell
me, sergeant, how is such a thing possible?
How is it conceivable that such a thing should
have gone on for weeks without anyone knowing
anything about it? Did you know anything
about it? You live with the men in the same
corridor; you must often, both by day and by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
night, have gone through the rooms&mdash;did you
not notice anything suspicious?"</p>

<p>Instead of an answer the sergeant-major
merely shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" demanded George;
"you don't mean to tell me that the whole thing
was an absolute and complete surprise to you?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly that," answered the sergeant-major
after a slight pause, "but when the time
comes for speaking I shall feel quite at my ease;
I am aware that I shall be called as a witness
at the investigation and must say on oath all
that I know about it."</p>

<p>"And what do you know?"</p>

<p>"Really very little, sir, and I can swear with
a good conscience that I have never seen or heard
anything, and I can equally truthfully swear
that no man has ever come to me and made a
complaint. I should have made myself liable
to punishment if anyone had made an official
complaint to me and I had not conveyed it to
the proper authorities."</p>

<p>"Quite true, and you say your conscience is
quite free from blame."</p>

<p>"I really think so, sir, and I am sure that they
cannot bring up anything against me at the
inquiry, and that is the important thing for an
old soldier who in a few months will have served
his twelve years and earned his gratuity and
pension."</p>

<p>"Outwardly that is so, certainly," agreed George,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
"but your words would seem to indicate that you
do not really feel absolutely free from all blame."</p>

<p>"You are right, sir. As I have just told you,
I have seen and heard nothing, but I have often
imagined that all was not going on quite satisfactorily
with the men under von Nissew. On
so many occasions one or other of his men had
fallen down and hurt himself, or he had knocked
against something in the dark. I have several
times taken von Nissew to task and said to him:
'You are not striking your men, are you?' and
naturally he answered in the negative. I ought,
perhaps, to have thereupon made a declaration
that he was lying, but what could I do? Ought
I to question the men behind a non-commissioned
officer's back? That would have been
the right thing most likely, but then there would
soon be an end to all discipline and subordination.
My God! when one thinks how easily one could
manage these fellows in former times, how one
could turn them round one's little finger, and
now? It is enough to make an old soldier
weep; and then the newspapers destroy and
undermine the little bit of authority we still
have left us, in spite of two-years' service, with
their cursed scribbling about the ill-treatment
of subordinates. You can't blame an old soldier,
therefore, if he does not do more than he is absolutely
obliged to get these stories published."</p>

<p>George partly agreed with him. "Still, it is
not right."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know, sir, but what would have happened
if I had officially reported something of which
officially I had had no intimation? They would
not have allowed me to extend my time in the
army; I should not have got my gratuity, and
then what would have become of me? Not that
they would have meant to punish me by refusing
to allow me to re-enlist; on the contrary, they
might even have commended my conduct, but
none of the higher authorities would have thanked
me for bringing to light such an affair without
the most pressing necessity."</p>

<p>George could not but assent to the sergeant-major's
views, and for the first time he asked
himself the question: "How will they thank
you for having unearthed this scandal?"</p>

<p>"Then you see I am a married man," continued
the sergeant-major after a slight pause, "you
know, sir, I have two children, and I don't want
to be suddenly turned out into the streets with
them. It is frightfully difficult for any of us to
get a situation; old non-commissioned officers
often hunt about for ever so long, for every
employment is crowded. So, of course, one
stays in the army as long as ever one can, instead
of twelve years, twenty, or even longer, for, at
any rate, one has one's work, one's pay, one's
home, and one doesn't risk all that unless one
is absolutely obliged. One shuts one's eyes for
the sake of one's own existence whenever one
can, and that is what I have done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you never speak to the captain about
von Nissew?"</p>

<p>"Very often, sir. I have repeatedly notified
to the captain that I thought Nissew ill-treated
his men."</p>

<p>"And what did the captain reply?" asked
George, with curiosity.</p>

<p>"At first he laughed in my face, then he grew
angry. You know, of course, that Nissew will
become a sergeant-major later on, and the captain
indicated by his behaviour that I was already
jealous of my successor. Now I had no reason
to feel this, because von Nissew must first be a
sergeant and corporal before he can relieve me
of my duties. I told the captain this, but he
still thought I was jealous because he protected
him, and he warned me to treat Nissew fairly
and not to be continually looking after him.
Well, then, I kept silent; only once did I speak,
and then I called the captain's attention to a red
mark, one could still see the box on the ear the
man had received. Of course the man belonged
to Nissew's company."</p>

<p>"Did the captain summon the non-commissioned
officer?"</p>

<p>"I do not think so, sir; he only asked me
whether I had never in my life given a man a
box on the ears. Well, of course, I couldn't swear
that I hadn't, and so the captain said he thought
I ought not to complain so much against Nissew
when I myself had committed the same fault."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>George was thoughtful. "Tell me, sergeant-major,
do you think the captain knew anything
about the way von Nissew treated his men?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think he did exactly, sir, for
Nissew was always very cautious. He seldom
struck men in the face, there were no visible
marks of his ill-treatment to be seen, and I
cannot understand how he so far lost his self-control
to-day as to strike Petersen in this manner.
No, the captain certainly knew nothing about
these things, but still I have often wondered
that he allowed von Nissew to have so much
authority over the men. Whoever was given a
punishment or anything similar had to report it
to von Nissew. I once complained about this
to the captain, for you see I am the sergeant-major
and I could not allow anyone to encroach
upon my duties without taking notice of it, it
looked as if I were not trusted. But the captain
said I ought not to make myself ridiculous. I
knew perfectly well he had every confidence in
me, I had quite enough to do, and simply to
lighten my duties and to relieve me of some of
them he had made this arrangement. When I
said to the captain there were still the sergeant
and the corporal he signified that I must really
leave to him the choice of whatever non-commissioned
officer he thought most suitable as
my deputy; this depended on the individual
and had nothing to do with rank."</p>

<p>"That is quite right, but it has always been a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
puzzle to me why the captain so specially favoured
von Nissew."</p>

<p>"Not to me, sir. I have known the captain
for years; he is a good-hearted man, but very
easily managed if anyone knows how to get
round him. And Nissew understood this better
than anyone else; he is always dancing attendance
on him, and running after him like a good
dog. I am only wondering what on earth the
captain will say when he returns from furlough
and hears of this affair."</p>

<p>"We must not let the captain wait for news
as long as that; he told me to telegraph to
him if anything important happened in the
company during his absence. I had quite forgotten
that. Please write a telegram immediately:
'Have had Non-Commissioned Officer
von Nissew placed under arrest pending investigation
on account of repeated ill-treatment of
subordinates.'"</p>

<p>The sergeant-major wrote the telegram and
George himself took it to the telegraph office.</p>

<p>Next morning the captain came back from his
furlough. Immediately on receipt of the telegram
he had cut short his holiday, and now he
was in a state of agitation which George could
neither understand nor account for. It is true
it was an unpleasant business, but still he ought
to be grateful to him for having discovered the
condition of affairs and so helped to put an end
to any further ill-treatment. Instead of this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
however, his superior officer was filled with a
rage and anger against George which transcended
all bounds. Immediately on his return
he had George sent for to barracks and spoke
to him in such a manner that it was almost
impossible for the latter to keep his temper
and endure his reproaches. "I am, of course,
far from approving of what von Nissew did,
but still less can I approve of your behaviour,
Lieutenant Winkler. You ought to have informed
me before taking any steps. I should
then have immediately returned and investigated
the affair myself, then it would have been
time to have taken action against the non-commissioned
officer. I must certainly rebuke
you for having acted so quickly, and without
due consideration; it almost looks as if you
wanted to stand on your dignity and vaunt your
authority. You knew what a high opinion I
have of von Nissew; out of regard to me you
ought not to have acted so impulsively, especially
as there was really no urgent reason for doing
so. Many questions evoke many answers&mdash;that
is always the case. You ought to have
quietly waited to see if Petersen or Meier would
make a formal complaint, then it would have
been quite time to have acted as you did; perhaps
then it would have been sufficient to have
summoned the non-commissioned officer and
threatened him with a formal charge if anything
of the kind happened again. Instead of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
you ask the men all kinds of questions until
at last you find out what you intended to find
out. You have always had a strong dislike to
von Nissew. Now that you have given vent
to it perhaps you are satisfied."</p>

<p>George, with a great effort, controlled himself.
"I should have acted in precisely the same manner
towards any other non-commissioned officer."</p>

<p>The captain laughed mockingly, and the blood
rushed to George's cheeks.</p>

<p>"I must request you most respectfully, sir,
not to cast any doubt on my words."</p>

<p>"And I must request you most emphatically,
sir, not to call me to account in this fashion.
If what I tell you is not to your liking you know
you have the right of making a formal complaint."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The captain was striding up and down the
reading-room like a wild animal; now he stopped
in front of George and his eyes were so fierce
and bloodshot that the latter was quite frightened.
He could scarcely recognise his superior officer
who had hitherto been the picture of tranquillity
and good manners.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Winkler, do you really understand
what you have done?" continued the
superior officer. "I will say nothing of the
unpleasant position in which you have put me,
but even if you did not consider me, you ought
to have thought of the regiment, and even of
yourself. Scarcely have people forgotten the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
scandal concerning little Willberg, scarcely have
we succeeded in allaying the suspicion that you
did not act quite rightly, than you reveal a
new scandal which all the newspapers will get
hold of. The Press of the whole world will
attack us, the regiment will be in everybody's
mouth, people will throw dirt at us, and some
of it will stick. If such a thing had happened
in another regiment, it would not have been so
bad, but we, as the Guards regiment, ought to
see that nothing whatever concerning us comes
under public notice that does not redound to
our credit. Dirty linen should be washed at
home; a stern rebuke, of which only the superior
authorities should have been informed in part,
would have settled the matter. You have
prevented that by your over-hasty report, the
battalion must now know of the affair, and a
public scandal is unavoidable. But that even
is not the end of the matter. His Majesty will
hear of the proceedings, and in spite of the great
favour you enjoy, His Majesty will not approve
of your conduct."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for venturing to contradict
you, but I know quite well what His Majesty
feels about the ill-treatment of soldiers."</p>

<p>"I do too," went on his superior officer, "but
it is not necessary to make a mountain out of a
mole-hill, and one should not stir up mud without
serious consideration."</p>

<p>Again the blood rushed to George's cheeks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
"I am not conscious of any wrong-doing. If
I have acted wrongly, however, I am quite
ready to bear the consequences."</p>

<p>The captain turned crimson. "You will soon
have to do that, whether you like it or not,
but that will not compensate me or the regiment.
Whether you get your discharge or not is a
matter of complete indifference to us; we have
managed to exist without you in the past, and
we shall continue to do so in the future. But
the matter is not over because you depart."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it may be if severe and righteous
punishment is meted out to the offender. If
the public see the severest punishment is given for
such offences public opinion will soon be allayed."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is what you think, do you?" said
the captain, contemptuously. "You will have
plenty of opportunity of explaining and justifying
your behaviour in this matter."</p>

<p>George was enraged at the unjust treatment
which his captain dealt out to him, but he determined
to keep to his resolution of making a
formal charge against the non-commissioned
officer. Next morning the captain returned to
the attack when he was summoned to the regimental
office. Indescribable excitement reigned
there; and although his superiors formally
praised his conduct and his strictly just treatment,
he was obliged to listen to things there which he
had not expected.</p>

<p>"You ought to have remembered that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
publicity, and perhaps even the trial would not
fall on the non-commissioned officer alone.
People will ask how was such a thing possible,
how could it have occurred if there had been
proper supervision on the part of the superior
officers. You, as a lieutenant, know perfectly
well that this supervision can only take the
form of warning the non-commissioned officers
continually that they must not ill-treat their
men, and pointing out to them the results if
they do so. We cannot be in every non-commissioned
officer's pocket, we cannot constantly,
by night and day, inspect the barracks, we
cannot do any more than is already done to
avoid brutal treatment. But, in spite of all this,
we superior officers are considered mainly responsible;
you will soon see what is the result
of this business."</p>

<p>The words of the superior officers plainly
showed the fear they had concerning their own
careers, and involuntarily George recollected
what his former captain had once said to him.
It was something of this sort: "The ill-treatment
of the soldiers will cease when there is a change
in two particulars. First of all, the officers
must not be worried by the superior authorities,
and the captain and the major must know that
one unfavourable inspection will not cost them
their posts. How they tremble at the sight of
an Excellency: the men are only drilled in what
will make a good show. What is good for this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
purpose the major yells out to the captain, the
captain to the lieutenants, and the lieutenants
to the non-commissioned officers. The curses
get worse and worse as they descend in the scale,
and the non-commissioned officers must be
veritable angels if they do not vent their anger
on the men, who, if not actually, are yet indirectly
responsible for the bad report. If a Tommy
holds his gun badly the captain is blamed for
not laying sufficient stress on the correct manipulation
of arms in his company; the reprimand
is unfair, and the authorities know that perfectly
well, but that does not matter: the point is,
the captain gets enraged and lets off steam.
Nobody to-day troubles about the training of
the men, each fights for his own existence. Discharge
daily threatens a man for a thousand
different reasons, and simply to postpone this
as long as possible all kinds of ill-deeds are committed
against the subordinates which cry out
to Heaven for justice. The path to advancement
to-day is strewn with corpses, and it will
only be different when we cease to live in an
age of inspection, and when a man no longer
works simply for his own benefit, but for the
whole army.</p>

<p>"Only then will tranquillity return to men's
minds, and they will no longer seek to obtain
by blows and ill-treatment what is far more
easily procured by kindness.</p>

<p>"That is the first thing. Secondly, this ill-treatment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
will cease when the superior officers
have the courage to look into all complaints,
to punish themselves what they see with their
own eyes, or to send them to the superior courts
for punishment. The only person who has
this courage to a certain extent is the very
rich officer, to whom it is a matter of no consequence
whether he gets his small pay or his
smaller pension; or the officer who stands high
in the favour of the authorities and can say to
himself, 'It will not affect my career if I report
the brutalities of my non-commissioned officers
for which I am in no way to blame.'</p>

<p>"But the officer who trembles and fears for
his future will naturally say to himself, 'I am
by no means too secure in my position, and if
it gets known that my subordinate officers ill-treat
the men I may as well get into civilian's
attire at once.' And who will blame a poor
captain or major if he tries to avoid reporting
a complaint, or warns a non-commissioned officer
instead of punishing him when he has struck
a man?"</p>

<p>George had then agreed with his captain, but
still he could not quite understand that the
authorities would have preferred his not bringing
to light this inconceivable brutality.</p>

<p>"I can imagine," said the colonel, "what
His Majesty will say to me. 'First the affair
with Willberg, and now this greater scandal
about the non-commissioned officers. Nice things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
seem to go on in your regiment.'" And then
the colonel added: "If this business costs me
my post it will be your fault, yours alone, and
it was just you I should never have expected
to play us such a trick."</p>

<p>George saw by this that the colonel, who
had so lately interposed on his behalf, expected
in return that George would have had more
regard for the reputation of the regiment, but
in spite of this George was really not conscious
of having done anything wrong; and an inner
voice told him that he had only acted as every
honourable man must have acted.</p>

<p>His comrades, just as much as his superiors,
blamed him for having reported the matter
officially to the authorities. Not that they
took the part of the non-commissioned officer;
on the contrary, there were universal exclamations
of the greatest indignation when George
told them how bruised and beaten about the
men were, but still, of more importance to them
than the well-being of the men was the good
reputation of the regiment.</p>

<p>First the affair in the officers' corps, then this
scandal with the non-commissioned officers&mdash;they
were lowered in the public estimation, and
in future people would naturally say, "There
are fine goings-on among the 'Golden Butterflies';
the lieutenants shoot themselves and
the non-commissioned officers thrash the men till
they cannot stand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>And once more George noticed that it was
doubly unpleasant to them all that it was precisely
he, the only plebeian in the regiment, who
had discovered the bad state of affairs that
existed in the company.</p>

<p>Again George passed through a terrible time;
his position amongst the officers was destroyed,
and officially his life was scarcely endurable.
His captain treated him with a contempt which
often made it scarcely possible for him to maintain
his self-control; the colonel jeered at him
whenever he could, and in his first lieutenant,
Baron von Masemann, he had an able assistant.
The latter entirely supported the captain, and
considered it now more than ever his duty to
educate George and to act as his schoolmaster.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the investigation was going on.</p>

<p>Immediately after the first examination of
the accused, on account of the seriousness of the
charge, the matter had to be reported to the
division. Almost daily there were examinations,
and half the company was always on its way
to the Court of Justice. Then only too soon the
whole extent of the ill-treatment became known;
with the exception of the few lance-corporals
there was not a single one among von Nissew's
men who had not been thrashed till the blood
ran, and the lance-corporals, urged on by von
Nissew and bribed by privileges which were not
permitted, had helped him to the best of their
power. They also had struck and ill-treated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
their companions as much as they could. Other
officers as well as von Nissew had ill-treated their
men, though not so badly, and in excuse for their
behaviour they had all given the same explanation:
"The captain forbade us to swear and
to use strong language. He threatened that he
would not allow us to re-enlist if we did not act
according to his regulations. We did not venture,
therefore, to use any strong language towards
our men; if we reported a man for idleness or
any other cause he was never punished, but
only warned to do his duty in future. We all
know that the captain is anxious to show that
one can command a company without administering
punishment."</p>

<p>The punishment-books of the company were
examined; according to the views of the superior
authorities that company was the best against
which the fewest punishments were written.
How much unhappiness have not these punishment-books
caused, and how many people have
not been ruined by them!</p>

<p>Of course, the superior authorities must
exercise some control, but not in the manner
that rules at present. It is difficult for the official
sitting at his desk to judge if the captain has
acted rightly when he punished a man with three
days' arrest. And then, fancy the openly-avowed
principle that that company is the best
in which the fewest punishments are officially
reported! Nothing can be more false than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
this or lead more easily to wrong treatment of
subordinates. This attitude taken up by the
authorities almost forces a captain to shut his
eyes and ears so as not to see or hear anything
that is punishable.</p>

<p>Captain von Warnow had always been opposed
to punishments, the evidence showed that clearly;
he wanted to have the best company, not
from any exaggerated military ambition, but
simply from personal feeling. Men who had
been punished were personally offensive to him,
and he could never get over this feeling. A
Guardsman in his company would receive a
reprimand, but was not put under arrest, and
so punishments in the guard-room became rarer
and rarer. Thus, in consequence of their captain's
views, which were very noble in theory
but impossible in practice, the non-commissioned
officers received no support from him. Yet the
captain demanded a tremendous amount from
his non-commissioned officers; the men were
to be the best in every respect, and this could
not be attained by kindness alone. The men
were not to be punished officially, they were not
to be cursed and sworn at; if an officer only
looked threateningly at a man he was warned
to treat him properly. What then was there
for the non-commissioned officers to do but to
take the matter into their own hands? They
vented their anger, not on duty, but in secret.</p>

<p>If a man did his drill badly this was reported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
to the captain, with the request that the fellow
should be ordered to drill again, but in the captain's
view such things should not be necessary
in a well-ordered company. Naturally, the non-commissioned
officers were vexed at this. They
said to themselves, "The fellows simply laugh
in our faces when we report them for punishment
and nothing happens." So when they
gave the men the extra drills they gave them
with locked doors, and punished them with the
utmost severity. Cuffs and blows rained down
upon them, and whoever betrayed by a look
or a gesture that he had not imagined it possible
to endure such treatment, was so shamefully ill-used
that he abandoned all idea of making formal
complaint. Frequently the men had to
get up at night and do their drill in the rooms,
clad only in their night-shirts, and whoever
made a false step was beaten with a heavy whip,
until the blood flowed.</p>

<p>A sad state of affairs was disclosed; the whole
company was called as witnesses, and the officers
likewise. The two lieutenants, Baron von Masemann
as well as George, said on oath that they
had had no idea of this ill-treatment, that no
complaint had reached their ears, and that they
had never seen or heard anything suspicious
when patrolling the rooms.</p>

<p>The examination of Captain von Warnow
revealed another side of the matter. He was
obliged to admit that what the sergeant-major<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
said was true. He confessed that on different
occasions his attention had been drawn to von
Nissew, but he had taken no notice of these
warnings. As a reason for this, he could merely
allege that von Nissew had seemed to him a
very kindly man, and that he would never have
credited him with such brutal behaviour. Further
than this he had nothing to say in excuse.</p>

<p>"Did you not know, Captain von Warnow,
that it was your duty to find out whether the
complaints made against the non-commissioned
officer were true or not?" asked the judge-advocate
who conducted the investigation.</p>

<p>Captain von Warnow stood up proudly. "I
believe that I have done my duty in every respect.
I have continually warned my officers to treat
the men properly."</p>

<p>The judge-advocate entered this statement
on the protocol, then he said: "Non-Commissioned
Officer von Nissew alleges as an excuse
for his conduct that you, sir, told him to deal
individually with all the weaklings and the
blockheads, as he expresses it. He regarded
this as permission to give the men extra drills,
and he alleges that it was simply his military
zeal and the feeling of responsibility for the
trust reposed in him which led him into striking
the men. May I ask why you entrusted so
young a non-commissioned officer with so much
authority over the men? In my opinion, sir,
you thus gave the non-commissioned officer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
opportunity and occasion to ill-treat the
men."</p>

<p>"That is merely your opinion, sir. I chose
the non-commissioned officer who seemed to
me most suitable in every respect for this individual
training, if I may so express it."</p>

<p>"Did it ever strike you von Nissew's men
very frequently limped or marched badly? Did
you never inquire what was the matter, and did
you never try to find out whether these accidents
of which they spoke really did happen? Just
now, when there are so many cases of ill-treatment,
you ought certainly to have inquired into
the meaning of these injuries. It must have
seemed to you very curious that these accidents
were of frequent occurrence among von Nissew's
men."</p>

<p>Captain von Warnow had listened to the judge-advocate
with astonishment, now he said: "It
almost seems to me as if you want to make me
indirectly responsible for the whole affair. I
must defend myself energetically against such
an idea."</p>

<p>The judge looked at him straight. "I am
certainly of the opinion that you are so far guilty
in that you failed to maintain proper supervision
over your non-commissioned officers. I feel
it my duty to state this in the official document."</p>

<p>The result of this was that Captain von Warnow
was formally charged with being indirectly
answerable for the ill-treatment, because he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
had not sufficiently looked after his non-commissioned
officers.</p>

<p>Captain von Warnow was suspended, and
Baron von Masemann was given the command
of the company. It was the sensation of the
day. Everybody was astounded, but the news
disturbed George more than anyone else. He
had neither intended nor desired that his report
should have such consequences. According to
the views expressed in the Casino, von Warnow
would be confined to his own quarters for at
least a month; perhaps he would also be forced
to resign; and, in any case, he could not remain
any longer in the regiment.</p>

<p>The anger of all was poured forth upon George,
who had been the cause of all the misfortune.
George suffered terribly from the unspoken
complaints of the others; he withdrew completely
from his comrades, and lived solitary.
He was not in the mood to go into Society, and,
indeed, how would he have been received? As
long as the examination of his captain was proceeding,
the latter did not go into Society, and
the result was that his women folk also abstained
from all gaieties. So George had no chance of
talking to Hildegarde, though just at this very
time he would so much have liked to see her,
and to hear from her whether she condemned
and misjudged his action, and whether she was
deeply angry with him for having involved her
relative in so much shame and unpleasantness.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER X<br />
  <span class="smcap">An Offer of Marriage</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sentence</span> had been pronounced. Non-Commissioned
Officer von Nissew received eighteen
months' imprisonment and at the same time
he was reduced to the ranks; four other non-commissioned
officers of the company received
six months'. A few days later the court-martial
sentenced Captain von Warnow to four weeks'
imprisonment in a fortress, because, by not
properly supervising his non-commissioned officers
he had contributed to the ill-treatment.</p>

<p>The "Golden Butterflies" crept about quite
broken-hearted. There was no laughter or merriment
in the Casino now; they scarcely ventured,
indeed, to give orders to the orderlies, for what
must they think of their superiors? If only
the proceedings could have been carried on
without publicity! but a charge brought into
a law court could not be disposed of in this
manner, and so the whole ugly story was once
more in the newspapers. The Press of all shades
of opinion expressed the severest judgment on
the events; they threatened, indeed, to ask a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
question in the <i>Reichstag</i> as to how such occurrences
were possible, and the case aroused long
discussions concerning the value of regulations
against the ill-treatment of soldiers, when the
superior officers did not insist upon them being
carried out. The newspapers were daily filled
with long reports.</p>

<p>But even that was not the worst. His Majesty
had had a long detailed report of the affair, and
had demanded the documents, and in unmistakable
language he had informed the officers
and non-commissioned officers that they had
forfeited his favour and patronage, and that it
would be a very long time before they would
regain his confidence.</p>

<p>"We've had a knock-down blow;" somebody
at dinner used the expression, and struck
the nail on the head: "The Golden Butterflies"
had had a severe blow. They were conscious
of this in the way they were regarded in Society;
their comrades in the other distinguished regiments
quietly but unmistakably withdrew from
any intercourse with them. Not precisely from
any profound conviction, not indeed because
the others were enraged that such things should
happen in the "Golden Butterflies"; it was
indeed no concern of theirs if someone in the
regiment was chased about with blows. Similar
things happened every day in their own regiment;
in the Cavalry there was scarcely a riding
lesson when someone or other did not feel the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
whip. Blows were given everywhere, in some
regiments more, in some less, and when, therefore,
the other regiments officially declined
intercourse with the "Golden Butterflies" it
was simply and solely on the score of the publicity.
It would make a good impression on
the public if they were somewhat reserved in
their behaviour to the "Golden Butterflies";
it would appear as if they were better men.
And added to this, His Majesty's words soon
became known, and, therefore, it was only prudent
to be a little cold towards the "Golden Butterflies,"
for if His Majesty ceased to bestow his
favours upon the regiment, it was certainly quite
impossible for other people to protect it.</p>

<p>Yes the "Golden Butterflies" had fallen
from their high estate. They saw it most distinctly
when they gave their first banquet after
the unhappy event. As usual, they had sent
invitations to the other regiments, but almost
all had declined, only a few young fellows, whose
coming was of no importance, had accepted.</p>

<p>Baron Gersbach, the Uhlan, did not come,
though Count Wettborn personally invited him,
and promised him a long night of gambling.</p>

<p>But Baron Gersbach still declined. "Do
not take it as an offence, my dear count, but
affairs are not quite as they ought to be in your
regiment; too much about them has got into
the newspapers, and who can guarantee that
one of your men or one of your non-commissioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
officers who is occupied in attending on us will
not run round to a newspaper and relate piping
hot all that we have been doing. When one
of your lieutenants, through a perfectly inexcusable
indiscretion, draws down upon you such
a scandal, one cannot any longer wonder if your
men do the same thing. Well, I don't want
any of that, thank you. I have no desire to
get into the newspapers; I can assure you I
was delighted to get off so easily when Willberg
disappeared from this earthly scene. Do not
be vexed with me for speaking so frankly, but
as long as you have such people among you as
Winkler, we cannot keep up friendly relations
with you."</p>

<p>In vain Count Wettborn sought to say a good
word on behalf of George, but it was of no avail.</p>

<p>"Certainly, he has the best intentions,"
agreed the Uhlan; "but good intentions alone
are not sufficient; as sensible and experienced
men, one must consider consequences. Now
the consequences of his actions you know better
than I do, and the whole affair is by no means
pleasant for us. As Guard regiments we form
one whole, and, therefore, what affects one casts
its shadow on the others likewise, for people
do not say such and such a thing happened
in the 'Golden Butterflies,' but simply 'in the
Guards.' Such a thing is frightful, for more
than all the other regiments we must maintain
outwardly, at any rate, a good reputation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Something more than the ordinary performance
of our military duties is demanded from us,
and, therefore, we are sometimes obliged to
act with exceptional severity against our men.
And then suddenly an idealistic reformer comes
along, who wants to do away with all cuffs
and blows; that is all very well in theory, but
when it provokes open scandal, one simply can't
have anything more to do with him."</p>

<p>So the count was obliged to depart without
having obtained his object, and though until
then, from a feeling of justice, he had been the
only one who took George's part, he now came
to the conclusion that it was impossible for
Winkler to remain any longer in the regiment.</p>

<p>With this idea in his mind the count spoke
one day to the colonel. "We can't go on much
longer like this, sir, we are almost boycotted,
we shall never get another guest as long as
Winkler is here. He has brought us and himself,
let alone everyone else, into discredit. Formerly
one could not allege anything against him except
his plebeian descent, but now there is a very
strong feeling among the officers that he only
lodged the complaint because he is plebeian."</p>

<p>The colonel looked up with astonishment.
"I do not understand what you mean."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir, the thing is very simple.
The officers believe that in giving this official
information, Winkler, to a certain extent, wanted
to have his revenge, because we had not extended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
to him the hand of fellowship as he had expected.
He has, therefore, served us this trick and meant
to signify: 'I am the only plebeian among you,
but my ways are far more seemly than yours;
simply to avoid discredit falling upon your
regiment and your proud aristocratic names, you
shut your eyes and ears, and permit your men
to be ill-treated. But I can act and think with
less prejudice, I am less hide-bound by the
"caste" feeling which bids you preserve appearances,
and so I can act as my conscience dictates.
I am guided by my feeling of what is right alone
and not by false prejudices.'"</p>

<p>"But that's simply nonsense," exclaimed the
colonel.</p>

<p>"It may be, and I daresay such considerations
are far removed from Winkler, but the officers
credit him with these, and so what can one do?
Nothing is more difficult than to talk the officers
out of an idea which they have firmly seized
upon&mdash;you know that, sir, do you not?"</p>

<p>The colonel groaned. "God knows it cost me
trouble enough before to try and get the lieutenants
to try and listen a little to reason."</p>

<p>He lit his cigar again which had gone out,
and blew out great clouds of smoke.</p>

<p>"Dear count, let me give you some good
advice. If you are not given a pension soon
then leave the army before you become the
colonel and commander of a regiment. I can
assure you our path is not strewn with roses;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
we are answerable for everything; for the
training of the troops, the tone in the regiment,
for the non-commissioned officers, and last, but
not least, for the officers. It is a vale of tears.
No, I do not want to commit a sin," he continued
reflectively, "I have every reason, therefore,
to be grateful to Heaven, for had I known that
I should live to see this day, I should have taken
poison."</p>

<p>He pulled at his collar with his right hand
to make it easier, for he suddenly felt as if he
were being throttled.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he struck the table with a
tremendous blow, so that the count, who meanwhile
had been occupied in admiring his most
up-to-date patent shoes, started with fright.
The colonel noticed it, but paid no attention to
it. "It is a scandalous thing," he burst forth
in a rage; "we have weathered two storms
successfully and now a third threatens, called
Winkler. May God pardon me the sin, but I
wish he had never been born, or at least had never
come among us. He has certainly got no pleasure
out of it, and neither have we." The colonel
nervously patted his somewhat thin hair with
his right hand. "You are quite right, my dear
count, when you say quite simply we shall
never regain our credit until we have got rid of
Winkler. You call my attention to the impossible
state of affairs among the officers and
declare we cannot alter that until we get rid of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
Winkler. It is all very well to say that, but
how will you get rid of him? I cannot indeed
suggest any reasons for his exchange; when
His Majesty learns the real reason, when he
hears that even a single officer in the regiment
does not hold Winkler in high esteem, and that
it was he who gave information of the ill-treatment,
then&mdash;&mdash;" and the colonel shook his head.
"It's not to be thought about; there will be
such a crash as makes me shudder to think of.
I told you how extremely highly and appreciatively
His Majesty spoke of Winkler. Well, when I
inform His Majesty that the man does not
suit us, we shall get something compared with
which all former ungracious remarks of His
Majesty were but child's play. With all respect
to my most gracious Sovereign, I cannot help
saying, 'Do not go to your prince unless you
are summoned.' I cannot, you see, suggest any
reason to Winkler for his exchange, for if we are
to be just, it must be confessed there is absolutely
nothing against him."</p>

<p>The count went on polishing up his eyeglass,
then he said: "What you say, sir, is very
just. I was thinking over the matter last night,
and I came to the conclusion that it would be
ever so much better if Winkler's exchange did
not emanate from us; he must himself apply
for it, and if he will not do that, we must persuade
him to get a year's furlough. Probably he would
consider the matter in the interval, and would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
not care to put on a uniform again. But still,
even if he does, after the disagreeable experience
he has had with us, he will certainly not desire
to rejoin us, but will get into another regiment."</p>

<p>The colonel had been listening attentively,
now he nodded approvingly. "That would do,
dear count, that's not a bad way out of the
difficulty. Of course, I would recommend him
most warmly for leave of absence, and as His
Majesty regards him with great favour, there is
not the slightest doubt that his request would
be granted&mdash;if we can only once get him to
make the request."</p>

<p>"We shall soon be able to do that, sir, I will
speak to him at the very earliest opportunity."</p>

<p>In the evening of the same day on which
the count and the colonel had been talking
over George's future, George also conversed with
Olga on the same subject.</p>

<p>"I am tired of the whole thing, Olga, I shall
not stay here any longer; I am sick of knocking
my head against a stone wall that divides me
from my fellow-officers. I have made up my
mind to-day, I shall give in my resignation."</p>

<p>Olga, who lately had been almost daily with
George, and to whom he frankly expressed all
his thoughts, had clearly foreseen that sooner or
later it would come to this, nevertheless she was
startled by his words, and sought to dissuade
him but in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>"At least exchange into another regiment,"
she begged.</p>

<p>But George shook his head. "There's no object
in that, dear. I know, of course, I should not
be transferred to a miserable frontier garrison
where one is nearly driven crazy; on the contrary,
I should be sent to some fine town, but
what should I do there? I know that I should
take a certain position there, for one thing
because I have been in the Guards, if only for a
very short time, and that is thought much of
in the provinces, and for another, because I am
a rich man. For the latter reason alone I shall
be heartily welcomed, for everybody will be
delighted to be able to borrow from me. I know
that from my former experience in the garrison,
in all these little towns a newcomer who can be
regarded as a new source for loans, is f√™ted and
welcomed like a god: and everybody borrows
money from him, from the captain down to the
youngest lieutenant&mdash;even the ensign plucks
up his courage by aid of a drink, and requests the
lieutenant most respectfully for a loan of twenty
marks. I know the whole thing. I never asked
for a promissory note when I lent the money,
but they always gave me one, for in such matters,
one must preserve formality and act correctly,
but not a single man ever redeemed his I O U.
They are all lying now in my writing-desk,
carefully arranged, to some extent a contribution
to the history of the manners and morals of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
German lieutenants, a contribution to the study
of the characteristics of 'aristocratic persons.'"</p>

<p>He had risen and opened a drawer and was
turning over the papers which he had taken
out of a case.</p>

<p>"Look at these, Olga, you need not read
the names, they are of no interest to you. Here
is written: 'Herewith I pledge my word of honour
to return the loan of five hundred marks within
the next three months at latest.' 'Herewith
I give my word of honour to return the thousand
marks lent me to-day within&mdash;&mdash;' and on,
dear. Dozens of these documents are lying
here; dozens of unredeemed pledges given on
their word of honour, and yet these very men
who have broken their pledge are going about in
the world as haughty officers." He was silent
for a moment, then he said, "By Jove! these
lieutenants are quite different from other people;
to a certain extent they form a class by themselves,
and their ignorance and lack of understanding
in certain matters are really more
than <i>na√Øve</i>. I confess I don't understand these
aristocratic persons, and because I don't understand
them I can find no excuse for their doings
and acts, their thoughts and their feelings.
I can forgive them for what they have done to
me, difficult though that is, but I can scarcely
endure their fine airs in Society, especially when
there is scarcely any other class whose general
education is so poor and lamentable as that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
the officers. I was indeed nearly going to say they
could neither read nor write properly."</p>

<p>"Now, now, George," admonished Olga, "you
must not exaggerate because you are angry."</p>

<p>"I am not angry, I am only sad that things
are so bad with our officers. But I really believe
I have under-stated the case. The lieutenants
can read, but can they also write? Look at
these begging letters and promissory notes which
I just showed you; you will find beauties of
style there, compared with which those of the
everlasting fourth-form boy of the comic papers
are mere nothings. But that is not all. You
will find such spelling as would bring down public
rebuke upon a third-form boy. You may laugh,
Olga, but what I tell you is the sad fact. Of
course, my remarks only referred to the lieutenants,
and not to the superior officers, but how often
have I not noticed even among them how terribly
embarrassed they are if they have to make a
report suddenly. Every word is such an effort
to them that one feels truly sorry for them.
Yet, in spite of all this, in spite of the lack of the
simplest culture, all this arrogance and self-complacence!
Naturally, every one ought to be
proud of his calling, but this pride ought not to
degenerate into a perfectly fanatical arrogance.
Formerly people spoke of the young, well-educated,
knightly lieutenants, the perfect cavaliers.
Where are they now? You must go
with a lantern and search for them. I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
scarcely known one during my time of service,
and the few who enter the army straight from
their home, fresh and unspoiled, are only too
quickly infected with the spirit of caste, and the
demon of haughtiness takes possession of them.
Ask the parents whose sons have become officers
whether they are not often shocked at the conceit
and pretentiousness of the young fellows for
whom the best is not considered good enough;
whether they have not often bitterly repented
having allowed their sons to choose a profession
which often estranges them from their own parents,
who are too often only regarded as the source
of money for their frivolous or luxurious lives."</p>

<p>"George, you are exaggerating absurdly,"
said Olga, rebukingly.</p>

<p>"Do you really think so? I can only say
I have often known young lieutenants who are
really ashamed because their fathers are teachers
or something similar, but in spite of this they
are not ashamed to send home for more money
in order to maintain a good appearance. They
wish&mdash;no, according to their view they <i>must</i>
give the idea of coming from good families. I
was once at dinner and I heard with my own
ears how a lieutenant pretended his father was
a pensioned officer because he felt embarrassed
at having to say he was a doctor."</p>

<p>"Fi, that's a beautiful idea."</p>

<p>Count Wettborn had, therefore, an easy task
when he came to persuade George to go on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
furlough. He was much astonished when he
heard that George was quite determined to
send in his resignation, and to enter his father's
factory; but, naturally, he made no attempt
to dissuade him.</p>

<p>"And when do you think of sending in your
request?"</p>

<p>"In a day or two. My father writes to me
that he is commanded to an audience with
His Majesty, and that he will be here at the
beginning of next week. Although I am a completely
free agent in this matter, and can go
and come as I like, still I think it is my duty
to inform my father of my resolution as soon as
possible."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly," agreed Count Wettborn,
"a week sooner or later makes no difference."</p>

<p>And that was just what the officers thought
when they heard that Winkler was going. Whether
he remained a week more or less&mdash;that was a
matter of no importance&mdash;the thing was, they
were going to get rid of him.</p>

<p>"I say, boys, we'll be a little bit nice to him
during these last few days," suggested one of
the officers. "We will behave as if we were
rather sorry that he's going, for, after all, it's
not exactly his fault that he doesn't suit us.
Besides, it would be a good thing for us if the
memory of his last days among us was a pleasant
one; later on he will often tell stories of the days
when he had the honour of belonging to us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
and although, of course, it doesn't really matter
what he says about us to his shopkeeper friends,
still, it won't do us any harm if he says, 'The
"Golden Butterflies" are a damned fine regiment;
they're a charming set of good-hearted,
dear fellows who are second to none in their
friendliness and good fellowship.'"</p>

<p>But the proposal evoked no response. "For
his own sake he won't say much about his dealings
with us and how we drove him out."</p>

<p>But they all agreed, however, to drop every
appearance of ill-will and to be, at least outwardly,
polite and amiable during these last days.</p>

<p>George could scarcely suppress a contemptuous
laugh when he noticed the sudden change of
feeling, and an ironical word was always on the
tip of his tongue when his comrades asked sympathetically
after his future plans, and feigned
interest in all his concerns. Often he was sorely
tempted to cry out&mdash;"Don't trouble yourselves,
you know you can't disguise your joy in getting
rid of me." But he was silent. What was the
good of saying anything, the officers would not
have admitted their true feelings.</p>

<p>One day at lunch a comrade went so far as
to offer him a glass of champagne. He had just
won a few hundred marks in the Prussian
lottery and had received permission from the eldest
officer at the table to celebrate it in this way.</p>

<p>Winkler could scarcely believe his ears when
his companion said to him: "You'll do me the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
pleasure of drinking a glass of champagne with
me, won't you?"</p>

<p>George's first instinct was to cry out: "During
the whole time that I have been here not a single
human being has shown me the least kindliness;
I must, therefore, decline the honour." Anger
and indignation rose within him that now, just
as he was leaving, anyone should dare to show
hospitality to him, but suddenly his sense of
humour got the upper hand, the invitation
seemed so utterly absurd, and he accepted it
with thanks. "But only on one condition,"
he added, following a sudden impulse, and then
in a loud voice so that everyone could hear,
"On the day when my resignation is accepted
I should like to give a solemn farewell banquet
to my fellow-officers. I can only accept an
invitation if I know that I shall have an opportunity
of returning it. You will come, will you
not," he said, turning to his host, "and you&mdash;and
you and you?" He invited everybody at
the long table, and not a single one refused; all
were thinking the same thing: "If it pleases
him, why on earth shouldn't we for once have a
good spread at his expense? One isn't, therefore,
pledged to anything, the thing need go no
further."</p>

<p>George was overcome by a feeling of repugnance
towards his comrades when he found that
they all accepted his invitation: were they not
ashamed of accepting hospitality from a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
whom they had treated so badly? He had been
joking when he gave the invitation, and had felt
quite certain that they would all have made
excuses of some sort or another, and he had been
pleased at the idea of these excuses, and now
they had, one and all, accepted! And it did
not stop there; the officers inquired when and
where the dinner would be; not in the club-room,
it was to be hoped. The rooms, of course,
were beautiful, but always the same food. How
nice it would be to have it in one of the best
restaurants! A few pounds more or less wouldn't
matter to him, of course, and they hoped he
would order French champagne only.</p>

<p>"I heard rather a good story lately about
that," said one of the officers; "let's see, what
was it? Oh, yes, I remember; If you give
your guest German champagne and tell him it is
French, he will not be deceived, and will not
drink it; but give him French champagne and
say it is German he'll drink it right enough.
Mind you make a note of that, Winkler." George
promised to remember this and to send the
invitations as soon as he had spoken to his father
about it.</p>

<p>"When is your father coming?" George himself
did not know, and expected him daily; so
did the "Golden Butterflies." They began to get
anxious when still the old fellow did not come.
What if he was not coming at all? Perhaps
it had been the stratagem of George's to speak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
about his resignation and to try and produce
a change of feeling towards him; perhaps the
old fellow would not appear for ages, and it had
been a trick of George's to make fools of them,
to make merry at their expense, and to a certain
extent to have his revenge on them.</p>

<p>They were getting frightfully anxious about
the matter; the joy, therefore, was great when
one day at lunch in the Casino George's fellow-officer
in his company, Baron von Masemann,
informed them: "The manufacturer of trouser
buttons has arrived. I saw him last night in a
restaurant."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" was uttered by all; and
then the question was immediately asked, "What's
he like?"</p>

<p>"Quite impossible. The fellow wears a ready-made
tie, unstarched cuffs, and a pair of boots
that one can see at a glance were never made in
Berlin; and then at dinner the fellow cuts his
bread with a knife instead of breaking it."</p>

<p>"How awful!"</p>

<p>An exclamation of genuine indignation arose
from all present.</p>

<p>"Do stop," implored a young lieutenant;
"remember we have only just had our lunch."</p>

<p>"Calm yourselves, my friends," continued the
baron; "in spite of all drawbacks the old boy
has <i>one</i> great advantage."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"He has a daughter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>"What, really! Winkler never told us a
word about it."</p>

<p>All surrounded the speaker, eager with curiosity.</p>

<p>"Is she pretty?" asked one at last, and the
others pressed more closely to hear the answer.</p>

<p>The baron purposely delayed his answer for
some time, then he said: "Pretty? my dear
boys, she's much more than that, and although
she comes from the provinces she's awfully <i>chic</i>.
But you must see her figure. I can tell you&mdash;&mdash;"
and he smacked his tongue.</p>

<p>"Did you get introduced to her?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, no; I was with friends in
the restaurant, and had no opportunity of getting
rid of them, but this evening it will be all right.
I heard quite by chance that the old trouser-button
manufacturer reserved a table for himself
for to-day. I shall take good care to be there,
and when once I am introduced to the young
lady I have no fear about conquering."</p>

<p>"In other words, you are trying to catch the
gold fish."</p>

<p>Baron von Masemann calmly lit a cigarette.
"Someone will marry her. Why shouldn't I be
that someone?"</p>

<p>"Quite so, but do you think the <i>coup</i> will be
successful?"</p>

<p>The baron shrugged his shoulders. "Who
can say? One can but try. After all, one can't
get more than a refusal at the worst. And then
why should the old boy say 'No,' if I only succeed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
in making the daughter infatuated about me?
My family is first-class. I myself am not worse
than other fellows, and the few debts I have are
of no importance; the old fellow has plenty of
money, and ought to be delighted if he can get
such an aristocratic son-in-law for his money."</p>

<p>The others quite agreed; what reason indeed
could the father and daughter possibly have for
not receiving the baron with open arms? And
thereupon several of them regarded the suggested
engagement as a <i>fait accompli</i>.</p>

<p>"Were you on friendly terms with Winkler
when you were together in the company?"
one of the men asked. "Perhaps he'll have a
word to say in the matter."</p>

<p>"I was thinking about that last night," replied
Masemann. "We were certainly not particularly
friendly, but still Winkler ought to be very
glad to have me for a brother-in-law. In this
way he will remain to a certain extent connected
with the regiment, and that is really of very great
advantage to him. Only think what a position
the fellow will be able to take in Society if he can
say, 'My brother-in-law, Baron Von Masemann.'
That is almost as valuable to him as being aristocratic
himself. Naturally I shall manage not
to have too much of my brother-in-law, and shall
see that he is not always running in and out of
my house; but that's all later on, the present
thing is to try one's luck."</p>

<p>But that evening the baron had no luck; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
waited in vain for the Winklers. They were all
sitting in George's rooms, and the honorary commercial
adviser to the Emperor was telling them
of the audience he had had with His Majesty,
and how he had graciously inquired after George
and expressed his pleasure at the way George
had acted with regard to the ill-treatment of
soldiers. He went on to tell them how pleased
His Majesty was to hear a good report of him
from the officers and of his popularity among his
comrades. His Majesty greatly regretted that,
owing to other arrangements, he could not keep
his promise of asking George to dine with him
to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Did I not always tell you so?" concluded
the old man. "Do you remember how at first
you wanted to fling down your gun in despair?
Who was right&mdash;you or I?"</p>

<p>George exchanged a hasty glance with his
sister, whom he had informed of his resolution
yesterday; he had not wanted to spoil his father's
pleasure in seeing him again on the very first day,
and he also wanted to prevent his father from
saying anything about his resignation in his
audience with the Emperor. So he had kept
silent till this moment, but now he was obliged
to speak, and his father's last words made the
task easy.</p>

<p>"What if I am right after all, father. When
I tell you I am just as much an 'outsider' to-day
as I ever was, when I tell you that my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
position in the regiment was not improved by His
Majesty's praise of me, and that the officers'
story of my popularity was simply a lie to avoid
vexing the Emperor&mdash;what would you say then?"</p>

<p>The father looked at his son with astonishment.</p>

<p>"I do not understand what you mean!"</p>

<p>"I will explain myself a little more fully."
And he proceeded to relate in detail all that had
happened to him from the very first day he
entered the regiment; how they longed for him
to send in his resignation, and how, at last, he
had made up his mind to do so, not to please the
"Golden Butterflies," but simply in order to
be able to enjoy life once more.</p>

<p>The father listened, absolutely disconcerted,
then he struck a sounding blow on the table.
"And what if I forbid you to do so, and order
you to remain an officer for some time longer?"</p>

<p>George looked at him calmly. "You will
not command me to do this, father. You told
me when I entered the army I was perfectly
free to leave it whenever I liked, and you will
not go back from your word."</p>

<p>"But what if I do&mdash;what if I don't want the
other officers to triumph in your failure?"</p>

<p>"Then I should resign in spite of it. I am of
age and can do what I like."</p>

<p>The old man was on the verge of losing complete
self-control. "And what if I disinherit
you?"</p>

<p>"I should still do it. I have savings enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
to live quite free from all anxiety for some time
to come, and as your son I shall soon get employment
somewhere."</p>

<p>Again his father was about to burst forth
indignantly, when Elsa broke into the conversation
and tenderly soothed him. "Don't oppose
him any more," she entreated. "George
thoroughly discussed the matter with me yesterday,
and to-day I vainly tried to get him to change
his mind; he is so unhappy as an officer that
one can't wish him to be forced to endure it any
longer."</p>

<p>The old man sat silent for a long time. "Mother
will be frightfully upset," he said at last.</p>

<p>The brother and sister exchanged swift glances;
they knew that the battle was won, but they
took care not to give vent to their feeling of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Won't you mind leaving the army?"</p>

<p>"How could I, after all the humiliation I
have endured? I rejoice a thousandfold in
taking off my officer's uniform, which apparently
does not go with my views and ideas, although
I did my duties very well compared with others."</p>

<p>"Is not every officer an enthusiastic soldier,
then?" asked Elsa.</p>

<p>George burst out laughing. "You innocent
angel! I can assure you at least half of the
lieutenants would give in their resignations at
once if they were in a financial position to do so.
The best proof of my assertion is that every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
lieutenant tries to find a rich wife; when he has
found one he either leaves the army immediately,
or stays there as long as he gets any enjoyment
from it. If it becomes too dull or worrying for
him he throws up his commission and says to his
superiors, 'See how you can manage to get along
without me. Other people can be driven mad
by your worrying ways, thank Heaven I am no
longer obliged to put up with all these things.'
Of course there are exceptions; there are the
ambitious and energetic men who want to get
big military appointments, who dream of red
stripes on their trousers and the title of Excellency;
it may be hard for such men to have to leave the
army. And then there are certainly a few who
are really soldiers, heart and soul, but their
number is small&mdash;where are they to be found?
Among the subordinate officers I have scarcely
known a single lieutenant who did not curse and
swear when he was set to perform a duty, and
who would not have preferred to depart at
once if only he knew how he was to earn his
living. This sounds hard, but I assure you it is
quite true. Even when a lieutenant says, 'I
like being an officer,' it is generally because of the
position it gives him in Society and not because
he likes exercising and drilling the men. And
it is just the same with the captain as with the
lieutenant; his superiors are always running
after him, they lead him a hell of a life, and are
always reprimanding him for some fault or other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
committed by his men. Who could enjoy military
duties under these circumstances? A man feels
stifled. Yet the wretched captain must bear it
all because he has a wife and children and no
money, because he is forced to remain in the
army as long as possible to get the higher pension
and so be able to live. He is worried and bothered
from morning to eve, and even then, in the
majority of cases, he does not succeed in getting
what he wants, and has later on to suffer poverty
and misery; and if he abandons his uniform
with regret it is not because he is sorry to leave
the army, but because of his wasted life. He is
in full possession of all his mental and physical
faculties, and yet he is condemned to inactivity
and ceaseless money worries. Among the superior
officers there is certainly to be found an enthusiasm
for the army. There is none among the subordinates,
at least not in the infantry."</p>

<p>The father was peevish and ill-tempered;
he controlled himself as well as he could, but
from time to time his indignation burst forth,
and his children found it difficult to appease him.</p>

<p>"And are you really going to give in your
resignation to-morrow? Will you not consider
it for another month? Why do you not get
leave of absence for a year, or less, if you like?"</p>

<p>George shook his head. "The sooner I
go the better, father. I don't get on among
the officers, who often have the most extraordinary
views on things." And, as if in con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>firmation
of these words, the servant brought
in a letter at that moment.</p>

<p>"Is there any answer?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The servant went away and George opened the
letter.</p>

<p>"Whatever is the matter?" asked Elsa, who
had been watching her brother while he was
reading.</p>

<p>George jumped up. "I have never heard such
a piece of insolence in my whole life. Just listen
to this; but first of all I must recall to you one
of my fellow-officers who was sitting in the same
restaurant with us yesterday."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that odd young man who was not
quite sure at first whether he should bow to us,
and then afterwards attempted to flirt with
me so outrageously," said Elsa. "Well, what
about him?"</p>

<p>"Not much," answered George apparently
calmly. "He merely wishes to be allowed to
ask for your hand."</p>

<p>Father and daughter looked at one another,
speechless with astonishment, then Elsa broke
into a hearty laugh, in which the others joined
too.</p>

<p>"Why, he doesn't even know me," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, that isn't in the least necessary; he
knows your fortune, he knows that you are
a very good <i>parti</i>, and naturally that's quite
enough for him. A man can get on all right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
without love, but not without money. Well,
now, listen to what this fine fellow writes. But
I must tell you beforehand that from the first
few of my comrades were so unfriendly to me
as he was."</p>

<p>Then he read out the letter:</p>

<div class="blockq">

<p>"<span class="smcap">My very dear Winkler</span>,&mdash;I am sitting
alone and solitary in the restaurant, and for a
whole hour I have been impatiently watching
the door in the hope of seeing you and your
people come in, for I heard by chance that your
father had ordered dinner here for this evening.</p>

<p>"Without telling you, you will, I expect,
have already guessed that I only went into the
restaurant to-day in the happy expectation of
being introduced to your sister and your much-respected
father, for I must frankly confess to you
that no young girl has ever made such a deep
and indelible impression upon me as your sister
did. Although up to now I have only had
the opportunity of observing her beauty and
her grace, yet I am quite sure that a beautiful
soul must dwell in such a beautiful body, and I
have only one wish in the world&mdash;to become
acquainted with your sister. As we have always
had such pleasant and friendly relations with
one another I venture to ask if I may pay my
respects to your highly-esteemed father and
beautiful sister, and I beg you most courteously
to say a few kindly words on my behalf. Naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
all information concerning myself and my financial
position is at your father's disposal whenever he
likes. In conclusion, I beg you not to be vexed
at the somewhat odd nature of these few lines,
but I know that your father is only staying here
for a few days, and I do not want your sister to
leave Berlin without my having the opportunity
of becoming acquainted with her.</p>

<p>"Pray accept my kindest regards for your
honoured, but at present, alas! unknown,
relatives, and,&mdash;Believe me, with best greetings,
yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="toright">"<span class="smcap">Von Masemann</span>."</p>

</div>

<p>"Well, what do you say to that?" inquired
George.</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" cried out the old manufacturer.
"I must say I have never heard of
such a thing in all my life."</p>

<p>"And what do you think about it, Elsa?"</p>

<p>"I really do not know whether to laugh or
be angry about it. I can't think how he isn't
ashamed to write such a letter."</p>

<p>George laughed mockingly. "Ashamed?
Why, Elsa, you can know very little about a
lieutenant if you think he would be ashamed
of anything. Your beauty has turned his head,
you have a big fortune, so that's all right; he
marches to victory like Blucher to Waterloo.
If he's successful, all right, if he's not, then he
seeks his luck somewhere else; he means to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
catch a goldfish somewhere or other. The more
impudent he is the more easily he attains to the
object of his desires."</p>

<p>"Not as far as we are concerned," burst out
the commercial adviser to the Emperor. "Please
tell your aristocratic friend to-morrow from
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>George interrupted him. "No, father, I have
already settled about the answer. He won't
much care about it, I can assure you. I am
going to ask him how it is, that he has been
unable to have any social intercourse with me
and yet desires to marry my sister." After a
pause he continued, "It is really a pity, Elsa,
you are not going to stay here a few days, for
then you would have had all the officers at your
feet; all, from the oldest staff-officer down to the
youngest lieutenant, would try to curry favour
with me so that I might say a good word to you
on their behalf. Your thousands would induce
even the most aristocratic lieutenant who usually
boasts of his numberless ancestors, to recognise
the <i>bourgeoisie</i> and to condescend to make you
his highly-honoured wife."</p>

<p>"A fine set of people these," said the father,
angrily.</p>

<p>"I thank them for the honour they pay me
in wishing to marry me for my money, but I
don't think I want to marry at all."</p>

<p>George regarded his sister with amusement.
"Ha, ha, one day you'll find the flame of love,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
and quite right too. By the way, how old are
you&mdash;nineteen or twenty?"</p>

<p>"I am twenty-one now."</p>

<p>"And has no one seriously paid court to
you?"</p>

<p>She burst out laughing. "Oh, often, like
your comrade here to-day, but I did not care
about any of them, for, oddly enough, it was
always officers who paid me attention, always
lieutenants, and, unfortunately, the only lieutenant
whom I love I cannot get."</p>

<p>George looked at her wonderingly. "Why
not?"</p>

<p>"Because he happens to be my brother."</p>

<p>Laughingly George drew his sister to him.
"Come here, dear, and give me a kiss." Then
he went on. "But seriously, Elsa, you have
grown much more beautiful lately." He was
delighted with his sister's looks: she had a
slim figure, a proud bearing, beautiful eyes, and
her whole appearance was charming.</p>

<p>"Do you know that you are very like Hildegarde
in many ways?" he said, suddenly.</p>

<p>It was the first time that he had actually
said her name to his people, and now that he
had done it he felt shy and was quite embarrassed
at his sister's glance.</p>

<p>Their father had meanwhile taken up the
evening paper, now he laid it aside. "Go
on, George, you yourself began it, you know.
You have so often written to us about your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Hildegarde. Who and what is she, and how do
you stand with regard to her?"</p>

<p>George tried to avoid answering, but Elsa
urged him to speak. "Do tell me something
about her. In your letters you could not write
enough about her&mdash;at any rate, in the beginning!
lately I have heard much less about her. Is
she vexed with you about anything?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so," answered George,
after a moment's thought; "at any rate I do
not know of any reason for it. I told you that
Hildegarde was a relative of my captain, who
is now undergoing imprisonment in a fortress.
Naturally during this time Frau von Warnow does
not go out, and so, lately, I have only seen Hildegarde
once or twice quite casually in the street."</p>

<p>"Haven't you spoken to her at all?"</p>

<p>"Twice I meant to do so, but I should have
had to inquire how the Warnows were, and, of
course, that would be very disagreeable for me."</p>

<p>"But how do you stand with regard to her,"
his father asked for the second time. "You
know your mother has prophesied for a long
time that you were going to get engaged to her.
Is she right?"</p>

<p>"As you ask me straight out, I will tell you
that at first I had the same idea, and I think that
if this horrible business had not come between
us, and if we had seen one another more often,
things would have been all right, but now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Elsa saw such a sorrowful and despairing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
look in her brother's face that she said to him,
"But won't you find it very hard to go away
without seeing her again?"</p>

<p>"I shall see her once again," answered George,
with determination. "I shall pay a farewell
visit. I shall ask Hildegarde to name an hour
when I am sure to see her." And then, acting
on a sudden impulse, he said: "By the way,
Elsa, I told Hildegarde all sorts of things about
you. I told her you wanted to become acquainted
with her, and she was delighted. Will you do
me a favour and call upon her, or, better still,
ask her to call upon you at the hotel? I will
be there, too, and then when we meet again
after several weeks we shall know what we feel
towards one another, and if Hildegarde loves
me, then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not so fast, my boy, not so fast," put in the
old man. "I am still in existence. I should like
to see my future daughter-in-law before I am
called up to consent and say 'Amen.'"</p>

<p>George had a sudden vision of Hildegarde;
the memory of the delightful hours they had
spent together awakened in him a great longing
to see her again.</p>

<p>"Oh, you will like Hildegarde, father, she is
beautiful and good, and in spite of her aristocratic
birth she does not share the often extraordinary
views of her class. I have told her a great deal
about you, father; about the factory, your
consideration for your workpeople, your ceaseless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
activity, and she was interested in and understood
everything." He spoke of her with an
ardour and an enthusiasm which showed how
much he cared for her.</p>

<p>"And what sort of a family has she?" inquired
old Winkler. "You know I don't care whether
she has money or not&mdash;you need not trouble
about that&mdash;what I mean is, do you know anything
about her relations? Has she any brothers
and sisters? What are her parents?"</p>

<p>George gave what information he could.</p>

<p>"Oh, so there's a scamp of a lieutenant,"
grumbled the father; "instead of parents who
have no money making their son learn some
business or other, the young fellows have to
become officers, so that they may get drunk
on champagne at the regimental banquet."</p>

<p>"But Hildegarde cannot help that," George
said, as if he had to protect her: "and what
does her brother matter to me?"</p>

<p>"What does he matter? Well"&mdash;the old
man got up&mdash;"a man does not only marry a
wife, but the whole family, take that from me,
my boy, and so, before taking any steps, we
must look into things a bit. But I will frankly
confess one thing to you: I have privately long
desired you to marry. It's all the same to me
whom, as long as you love her. Well, now we
can go and see your Hildegarde."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
  <span class="smcap">Farewell to the Army!</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">"<span class="smcap">My</span> son just engaged to your daughter. For
Hildegarde's sake will try to assist you and your
son. Expect you both to-morrow for consultation
on subject."</p>

<p>This telegram sent off by the old manufacturer
caused indescribable excitement in the major's
home; weeping with joy and agitation the
husband and wife flung themselves into each
other's arms and blessed the day on which Heaven
had given them Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"A fine girl, a good girl," said the major a
dozen times over, and if there was anything that
troubled his intense joy it was that Hilda was
not with them. He would so much have liked
to take her in his arms, and in his somewhat
rough fashion to have patted her on the shoulder
and said: "You have done well, my girl."</p>

<p>He laughed hoarsely, and lit the dearest cigar
he had in the house. One ought to make merry
on festivals whenever they occur, and to-day
was truly a festival: Hildegarde engaged to the
son of one of the richest wholesale manufacturers,
that was indeed more than mere good luck, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
almost unconsciously the major folded his hands
and thanked the good God for having sent him
so rich a son-in-law. He read and re-read the
telegram; he could not at once take in the whole
extent of the joyful news, and the oftener he
read the telegram and the more calmly he
gradually accepted its contents, the more he took
exception each time to the words: "For Hildegarde's
sake will try to assist you and your son.
Expect you both to-morrow." What did that
mean&mdash;will try; it was not a question of <i>will</i>,
but <i>must</i>. Did this <i>parvenu</i> imagine, perhaps,
that the major would give his beautiful child,
his only daughter, to his son without his having
to pay heavily for it? Oh, no, indeed! No gains
without pains; if the honorary commercial adviser
did not pay his debts and his son's, then there
would be no engagement, for he, as father, would
never give his consent. That would indeed be a
fine thing if he gave his child to the first best
suitor without any compensation. "No, no, that's
not what was intended, that won't do at all."</p>

<p>The major talked himself into a rage over the
matter to his wife, who vainly tried to calm him.
"You don't know these shop-keeping creatures,
they grow rich by haggling; their chief characteristic
is avarice, and you see all that here. Do
you suppose a decent man would ask what were
the debts of the father and mother of his future
daughter-in-law? He would simply pay them,
and on the spot. And what does this fellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
say: 'Expect you both to-morrow to discuss
affairs.' He ought to come to us, and ask for
our daughter's hand on his son's behalf in the
proper way, instead of which we are simply commanded
to come to him. I, an old major, must
receive instructions from a <i>parvenu</i>. He has not
a trace of respect for my noble birth, my position,
my name; he has the money-bags, so we must
pipe to his tune. Well, I shall soon make him see
how matters stand, I shall soon show him what an
honour it is for him and his family if we let his
son, who, as far as I know, is only a discharged lieutenant,
marry our Hilda. I will soon open his eyes."</p>

<p>He walked up and down the room grumbling
and cursing, but gradually joy in Hildegarde's
engagement again got the upper hand, and earlier
than usual he went off to his special table at the
restaurant in order to relate the news and to
receive congratulations on the happy event.</p>

<p>Next morning he set out on his journey; his
wife had wanted to accompany him, but he
would not allow this. "Fritz and I must first
have a talk with the old man and arrange affairs.
I will telegraph you how things are, and then you
might come. I repeat, if the old fellow does not
pay up at once, there will be no engagement."</p>

<p>Fritz, who met his father on the way, quite
agreed with him. He had also received a telegram
in which was expressed only a <i>desire</i> to help,
and he was no less angry than his father. "You
are quite right in what you say, papa, there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
only one thing to be done, we must simply
threaten to take Hildegarde immediately home
with us if he does not consent to everything
we want. We must act very energetically, and
show fight, but above all we must make the old
fellow feel what an enormous social barrier
divides us; then you see he will look small."</p>

<p>But the old manufacturer was very far removed
from looking small.</p>

<p>In the conversation that had taken place between
Hildegarde and Elsa, the former had considered
it her duty to tell her new friend frankly
about her family affairs, and to confess quite
plainly how she had been sent year after year
to Berlin to get a rich husband. With tears
she confessed she loved George, but declared
she must renounce him, for she could not endure
that George should believe, even for a moment,
that she loved him for his money. At first
when Elsa heard this she assumed a somewhat
distant air, then she felt the most sincere sympathy
for Hildegarde, whose every word showed clearly
and distinctly how good and true she was. Elsa
tried to console her to the best of her ability,
and assured her that George would not doubt
her, but that his love would be all the greater
when he heard what a sad life she had had. Elsa
undertook to inform her father what Hildegarde
had told her, and at the first moment he was
quite overcome, and kept on saying to his son&mdash;"George,
leave the thing alone, give up all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
thoughts of Hildegarde, don't be drawn into
that wretched family affair." But he made no
further opposition after he had seen Hildegarde
and had had an hour's conversation with her
<i>t√™te-√†-t√™te</i>. He took his son aside and said,
"George, the girl's an angel, we must make her
happy and compensate her for all she has gone
through by a future without a care or worry."</p>

<p>So they had all taken counsel together as to
how Hildegarde's relatives were to be helped.
Hildegarde had told them the extent of the debts
so far as she remembered it from her last visit
home, and at last it was arranged that old Winkler
should pay one half of the debts, and George,
out of his own income, the other. Besides this,
Winkler intended to put aside a certain sum
every year, from which Hildegarde could make
her parents an allowance, and so they would
be removed from all pecuniary anxiety.</p>

<p>It was more difficult to arrange what was
to be done about Fritz. George wanted to
pledge himself to give his brother-in-law a
monthly allowance, but Hildegarde shook her
head at this. "There is really no object in
doing that, George. If, in your kindness, you
were to give him thousands and thousands, it
would be so much money thrown away. The
more Fritz has the more he needs. He would
never manage on whatever he had; he would
always borrow from us, he would not stop gambling,
and if we wouldn't help him he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
borrow on I O U's, and would soon be as deeply
in debt as he is to-day. It is sad for his own
sister to have to say this, but I can only see one
way of helping Fritz&mdash;he must leave the army
and go abroad. He will never be any better
until he works and earns his own living and so
gets to understand the value of money."</p>

<p>"Hildegarde is right," agreed the old manufacturer.
"Hildegarde is certainly the most
sensible girl I have ever known, and if she, who
knows her brother so well, says that there is no
other means of helping him except a change of
climate, then he shall have it. Let him go to
America, I have business connections there, and
can easily get him a post. He shall not starve,
I will see to that all right, but he shall only get
as much money as will keep him from want.
He will therefore be forced to work for his living."</p>

<p>Thus all was settled and arranged when the
major and his son arrived, and at the sight of
the absolute calmness and firm determination
which were visible in the manufacturer's whole
bearing, they were quite unable to carry out
their proposal and take the high hand. They
could not explain why, but as they sat with
the old man, they were almost ill at ease when
he asked them about their debts, and told them
in what way he proposed to settle them.</p>

<p>Fritz could hardly believe his ears when he
was told he was to leave the army. He opposed
it as much as ever he could, but he was so deeply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
involved that he could not hang on for more
than a few weeks. It would, therefore, be best
for him after all to resign at once. But if he
left the army there was really no object in paying
his debts at once; the people could wait for
them, he would be quite content to go on owing
them money. He made this clear to old Winkler,
who might thus save the money and give him
a few more thousand marks for his journey.</p>

<p>"For you to gamble them away on board
ship. No, there's no sense in that, and quite
apart from that, in our plebeian circles it is
considered honourable to fulfil one's obligations.
Surely you, who belong to a class which is nicknamed
nowadays 'the first class,' ought not
to think differently in this matter. I should not
have expected this of you."</p>

<p>Fritz could not help feeling uncomfortable,
and both father and son were delighted when
Elsa inquired whether lunch could not be served,
and so brought the conversation to an end.</p>

<p>The major was in the seventh heaven: his
debts were paid, he received an extra allowance,
he had no longer any need to give his son any
money, and henceforth he could live free from
care. He did not, of course, quite like it that
his son Fritz should have to go abroad, but
if the old manufacturer insisted upon it, why
one must agree to it, and perhaps he might
find a rich wife there. In America there were
still people who thought aristocratic birth more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
than out-weighed gold, and, besides, America
was not far off, he could be back again in a few
days, if need be. He whispered all this to his
son, when he was alone with him for a moment,
and Fritz made the best of a bad bargain. Father
and son thoroughly enjoyed the excellent luncheon
of which they all partook, and appeared to take
no notice of the somewhat cold, distant behaviour
of the Winklers at the beginning of the interview.</p>

<p>Next day the manufacturer with his children
and Hildegarde intended to go home.</p>

<p>He would indeed have gone on this day but
George, who had given in his resignation, had
invited the "Golden Butterflies" to a splendid banquet,
and at six o'clock the whole of the corps of officers
were assembled in a splendid suite of rooms in
the best hotel in Berlin. George in his heart disliked
all this ostentation, but on this occasion he had
ordered the best and most expensive of everything.
The French champagne flowed in streams, the
finest wines, the best viands were set before them.</p>

<p>George as the host sat between the colonel and
the major, and secretly he was immensely amused
to notice how the former was beginning to think
about his speech.</p>

<p>"What is he going to say?" thought George.
"Does not the man see that this farewell banquet
is a pure farce? There is not a single being at
the table who is not delighted that I am going,
and yet they all come here to stuff themselves
at my expense, and to get more or less drunk."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few words George bade his guests welcome,
and wished them a pleasant evening. That
was all he said. He could not bring himself
somehow to say that he was delighted to be once
more among his dear old comrades again, or
something of the kind. He had only said what
was absolutely necessary for the occasion, and,
therefore, he was all the more curious to see how
the colonel would reply to his remarks. The
latter struck his glass, and rose, his example
being followed by all the other officers.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," began the colonel, amid profound
silence, "we are to-day assembled for the
last time to do honour to a beloved comrade,
who is leaving not only us, but the army, to go
into his father's business as worker and partner.
Although it is usually the custom for the departing
officer to be entertained by his corps, to-day
it is otherwise, and it is we who are the guests
and you the host, because we believe by this
means to show you, dear Winkler, how delighted
we are once more to have you in our midst.
To invite you to a dinner would have been the
ordinary etiquette of the regiment, but etiquette
does not oblige us to accept your invitation.
The fact that everyone of us is here is a clear and
eloquent sign, dear Winkler, that all who are
here have not a word to say against you. I cannot
deny that there were at one time differences
between you and the other officers, but to-day
shows that all those have disappeared. And so,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
with sincere regret, we witness your departure
from our midst, although you have only been
here such a short time, and our wishes for your
health and prosperity in the future are expressed
in the toast. Three cheers for our former comrade,
Lieutenant Winkler. Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!"</p>

<p>"Coldly as they received me into the regiment,
coldly they bid me good-bye," thought George
during the colonel's speech. "Not a single
kindly word for me, merely a variation on the
theme&mdash;what fine, good-natured fellows we are
for coming here to-day on your account."</p>

<p>The hurrahs rang out, the band struck up a
fanfare, and then the song, "Ich hatte einen
Kamraden, einen bessern fandst du nicht."</p>

<p>"I am to have that as well," thought George,
and a feeling of bitterness rose within him.
"Lies and hypocrisy to the very end."</p>

<p>The colonel drew him into the conversation, but,
while George was apparently listening to a description
of an incident in the war, his thoughts were
far away. He looked at his comrades who from
joy at getting rid of him had drunk more than
was good for them, and many of whom would
soon be completely intoxicated. And suddenly a
feeling of joy which he could not prevent came over
him that in future he would no longer belong to a
profession, the majority of whose members had
not yet learned to work and to take life seriously;
and who had not yet grasped the real nature
of its task&mdash;that of educating the German youth.</p>
